abstract = {Rationale: Repeated social stress experiences engender "behavioral sensitization" and may also increase the potential for abuse of psychomotor stimulants, particularly cocaine use during "binges." Objective: Experimental protocols were designed to induce behavioral sensitization through exposures to social-defeat stress or injections of cocaine or morphine. The impact of stress, cocaine or morphine sensitization on cocaine self-administration was assessed using several protocols. Methods: Behavioral sensitization was induced in male Long-Evans rats by four social-defeat stress episodes, each separated by 72 h. Expression was assessed following a challenge of D-amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) or cocaine (7.5 mg/kg or 10.0 mg/kg), 10–15 days after the last defeat. Sensitization to cocaine (15.0 mg/kg) or morphine (10.0 mg/kg) was induced via daily administrations for 10 days and later assessed by challenges with cocaine or morphine. Subsequently, i.v. self-administration of cocaine was analyzed for (i) rates of acquisition, (ii) sensitivity to various doses, (iii) "breaking points" during a progressive ratio schedule of cocaine reinforcement, and (iv) patterns of intake during a 24-h binge, in sensitized and control rats. Results: Social-defeat stress, cocaine or morphine administrations increased the locomotor response to stimulant challenges. During 24-h cocaine self-administration binges, sensitization to social-defeat stress or to cocaine prolonged responding, resulting in more cocaine intake. In addition, cocaine sensitization increased the rate of acquisition to cocaine self-administration and the breaking point during a progressive ratio schedule. Conclusion: The process of sensitization to social-defeat stress or cocaine intensifies cocaine intake during a binge, supporting the hypothesis that sensitization may facilitate the transition to compulsive drug taking.},

abstract = {Global self-esteem is a component of individual personality that impacts decision-making. Many studies have discussed the different preferences for decision-making in response to threats to a person's self-confidence, depending on global self-esteem. However, studies about global self-esteem and non-social decision-making have indicated that decisions differ due to reward sensitivity. Here, reward sensitivity refers to the extent to which rewards change decisions. We hypothesized that individuals with lower global self-esteem have lower reward sensitivity and investigated the relationship between self-esteem and reward sensitivity using a computational model. We first examined the effect of expected value and maximum value in learning under uncertainties because some studies have shown the possibility of saliency (e.g. maximum value) and relative value (e.g. expected value) affecting decisions, respectively. In our learning task, expected value affected decisions, but there was no significant effect of maximum value. Therefore, we modelled participants' choices under the condition of different expected value without considering maximum value. We used the Q-learning model, which is one of the traditional computational models in explaining experiential learning decisions. Global self-esteem correlated positively with reward sensitivity. Our results suggest that individual reward sensitivity affects decision-making depending on one's global self-esteem.},

abstract = {Cocaine addiction treatment is difficult due to the current lack of approved pharmacotherapuetics. Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that the mu opioid receptor (MOPr) antagonist/kappa opioid receptor (KOPr) partial agonist naltrexone (NTX) reduces the subjective effects and self-administration of cocaine. However, very limited research has examined the ability of the structurally similar MOPr antagonist/KOPr partial agonist nalmefene (NMF) to reduce cocaine reward. Here we examine the effect of low (1 mg/kg) and high (10 mg/kg) doses of NTX or NMF on cocaine place preference. In vivo characterization of these NTX and NMF doses were performed to examine their effectiveness at MOPr and KOPr. Results Both NTX doses and high dose NMF significantly reduced cocaine place preference. Conversely, a significant place avoidance was observed for high dose NTX and both NMF doses. Interestingly, neither NTX nor NMF blocked cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion. High dose NTX and both NMF doses fully blocked MOPr agonist morphine-induced thermal analgesia as well as KOPr agonist U50,488H-induced locomotor discoordination. However, low dose NTX fully blocked morphine analgesia but not U50,488H locomotor discoordination suggesting that low dose NTX is effective at MOPr but not KOPr. Conclusion Both NTX and NMF block the place preference, but not locomotor activating, effects of cocaine. These results suggest that both NTX and NMF may be viable pharmacotheraputics for some aspects of cocaine addiction. This is an important step to understanding the potential mechanism(s) of action of NTX and NMF for the development of more efficacious pharmacological treatments for substance use disorders.},

abstract = {$\mu$-Opioid systems in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens contribute to hedonic impact (“liking”) for sweetness, food, and drug rewards. But does the entire medial shell generate reward hedonic impact? Or is there a specific localized site for opioid enhancement of hedonic “liking” in the medial shell? And how does enhanced taste hedonic impact relate to opioid-stimulated increases in food intake? Here, we used a functional mapping procedure based on microinjection Fos plumes to localize opioid substrates in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens that cause enhanced “liking” reactions to sweet pleasure and that stimulate food intake. We mapped changes in affective orofacial reactions of “liking”/“disliking” elicited by sucrose or quinine tastes after d-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4-Glycol5-enkephalin (DAMGO) microinjections in rats and compared hedonic increases to food intake stimulated at the same sites. Our maps indicate that opioid-induced increases in sucrose hedonic impact are generated by a localized cubic millimeter site in a rostrodorsal region of the medial shell. In contrast, all regions of the medial shell generated DAMGO-induced robust increases in eating behavior and food intake. Thus, our results identify a locus for opioid amplification of hedonic impact and reveal a distinction between opioid mechanisms of food intake and hedonic impact. Opioid circuits for stimulating food intake are widely distributed, whereas hedonic “liking” circuits are more tightly localized in the rostromedial shell of the nucleus accumbens.},

abstract = {This study examines the cognitive and neural determinants of honesty and dishonesty. Human subjects undergoing fMRI completed a monetary incentive delay task eliciting responses to anticipated reward in the nucleus accumbens. Subjects next performed an incentivized prediction task, giving them real and repeated opportunities for dishonest gain. Subjects attempted to predict the outcomes of random computerized coin-flips and were financially rewarded for accuracy. In some trials, subjects were rewarded based on self-reported accuracy, allowing them to gain money dishonestly by lying. Dishonest behavior was indexed by improbably high levels of self-reported accuracy. Nucleus accumbens response in the first task, involving only honest rewards, accounted for ∼25% of the variance in dishonest behavior in the prediction task. Individuals showing relatively strong nucleus accumbens responses to anticipated reward also exhibited increased dorsolateral prefrontal activity (bilateral) in response to opportunities for dishonest gain. These results address two hypotheses concerning (dis)honesty. According to the “Will” hypothesis, honesty results from the active deployment of self-control. According to the “Grace” hypothesis, honesty flows more automatically. The present results suggest a reconciliation between these two hypotheses while explaining (dis)honesty in terms of more basic neural mechanisms: relatively weak responses to anticipated rewards make people morally “Graceful,” but individuals who respond more strongly may resist temptation by force of Will.},

Recent preclinical and human findings suggest that stress particularly affects reward anticipation; chronic stress perturbates dopamine signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum; and such effects are further moderated by early adversities. Additionally, a systems-level approach is uncovering the interplay among striatal, limbic and control networks giving rise to stress-related, blunted reward sensitivity. Together, this cross-species confluence has not only enriched our understanding of stress-reward links but also highlighted the role of neuropeptides and opioid receptors in such effects, and thereby identified novel targets for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.},

@misc{Pickett2005,
abstract = {Despite the obvious benefits of social connectedness, one of the barriers to its achievement is social exclusion and rejection by others. Most societies, including non-human societies (Lancaster, 1986; Raleigh & McGuire, 1986), engage in routine rejection of some of their group members. This rejection is often the result of an individual failing to conform to some social norm or rule and can take the form of mild social rejection (e.g., a snub) to complete exclusion and ostracism (e.g., Williams, 2001; Williams & Zadro, this volume). Although it is clear that many negative emotional and behavioral consequences can result from social exclusion and rejection, what is not well understood are the specific ways that individuals deal with daily rejection experiences and how they avoid prolonged social exclusion. Most individuals encounter some form of mild rejection in their daily lives--e.g., being turned down for a date or being left out of a conversation. While these experiences may result in temporary feelings of dejection, many individuals are able to bounce back from these episodes and regain inclusion and belonging. But what are the processes and mechanisms that contribute to individuals' ability to recover from and avoid rejection? The goal of this chapter is to provide a potential answer to this question by describing a model for the regulation of belonging needs (see Figure 13.1). This chapter begins with a description of the components of the model and the model's relation to other known processes involved in detecting and responding to social exclusion. This is then followed by a summary of the evidence collected to date in our lab that bears upon various aspects of the model. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {It is well established that a lack of social support constitutes a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality, comparable to risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure. Although it has been hypothesized that social support may benefit health by reducing physiological reactivity to stressors, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Moreover, to date, no studies have investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms that translate experiences of social support into the health outcomes that follow. To investigate these processes, thirty participants completed three tasks in which daily social support, neurocognitive reactivity to a social stressor, and neuroendocrine responses to a social stressor were assessed. Individuals who interacted regularly with supportive individuals across a 10-day period showed diminished cortisol reactivity to a social stressor. Moreover, greater social support and diminished cortisol responses were associated with diminished activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and Brodmann's area (BA) 8, regions previously associated with the distress of social separation. Lastly, individual differences in dACC and BA 8 reactivity mediated the relationship between high daily social support and low cortisol reactivity, such that supported individuals showed reduced neurocognitive reactivity to social stressors, which in turn was associated with reduced neuroendocrine stress responses. This study is the first to investigate the neural underpinnings of the social support-health relationship and provides evidence that social support may ultimately benefit health by diminishing neural and physiological reactivity to social stressors.},

Here we discuss evidence that these transitions depend on interactions between pavlovian and instrumental learning processes. We hypothesize that the change from voluntary drug use to more habitual and compulsive drug use represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior as well as a progression from ventral to more dorsal domains of the striatum, involving its dopaminergic innervation. These neural transitions may themselves depend on the neuroplasticity in both cortical and striatal structures that is induced by chronic self-administration of drugs.},

abstract = {What are the genetic and neural components that support adaptive learning from positive and negative outcomes? Here, we show with genetic analyses that three independent dopaminergic mechanisms contribute to reward and avoidance learning in humans. A polymorphism in the DARPP-32 gene, associated with striatal dopamine function, predicted relatively better probabilistic reward learning. Conversely, the C957T polymorphism of the DRD2 gene, associated with striatal D2 receptor function, predicted the degree to which participants learned to avoid choices that had been probabilistically associated with negative outcomes. The Val/Met polymorphism of the COMT gene, associated with prefrontal cortical dopamine function, predicted participants&#039; ability to rapidly adapt behavior on a trial-to-trial basis. These findings support a neurocomputational dissociation between striatal and prefrontal dopaminergic mechanisms in reinforcement learning.

Methods Thirty-six nonclinical undergraduates completed a probabilistic selection task. Participants were divided into depressed and non-depressed groups based on Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression (CES-D) cut scores. We then applied a reinforcement learning model to every participant's behavioral data. Results Depressed participants showed a reward-based decision making deficit and higher levels of the learning parameter $\tau$, which modulates variability of action selection, as compared to non-depressed participants. Highly variable action selection is more random and characterized by difficulties with selecting a specific course of action. Conclusion These results suggest that depression is characterized by deficits in reward-based decision making as well as high variability in terms of action selection.},

abstract = {Abstract The behavioral stimulant effect of peripheral cocaine injection into rats is augmented following daily adminstration. In vivo dialysis in the nucleus accumbens of conscious rats was used to determine if the increased behavioral response following daily cocaine administration is associated with in increase in extracellular dopamine concentration. Acute injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) produced and elevation in extracellular dopamine concentration in the nucleus accumbens. Following daily pretreatment with cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip ? 4 days), a subsequent acute injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) significantly elevated the extracellular dopamine levels compared to that produced by a single acute injection. Although the levels extracellular dopamine metabolites was significantly lowered by both acute cocaine and daily cocaine, no difference between these two groups of animals was measured. The increase in extrecellular dopamine following a single acute injection of cocaine was not correlated to the motor stimulant response. However, after daily pretreatment with cocaine the motor stimulant response to acute cacaine was positively correlated with the increased extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. These data demonstrate that enhanced dopamine release into the nucleus accumbens may mediate the behavioral sensitization produced by daily injections of cocaine, but that other neural systems are influential in mediating the acute motor stimulant effect of cocaine.},

abstract = {The possibility that morphine exerts its reinforcing effects via an action in the nucleus accumbens was investigated in the rat using the self-administration model and the method of intracerebral injection. Male, adult rats implanted with a chronic cannula aimed at this nucleus were tested for self-administration in a rectangular chamber equipped with two levers, one at each end. Each subject was given several sessions in blocks of two sessions for a given substance, the first session with the active lever at one end of the chamber, the next with the active lever at the other end. During a session, responses on the inactive lever were without consequences. Depression of the active lever was coupled with the presentation of a tone to facilitate discrimination between the two levers. All subjects received a sequence of 5 sessions, the first for habituation, the next two to test for effects of artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and the next two to test for effects of morphine. A few subjects in which the cannula had not been dislodged or plugged were further tested for effects of morphine and then for effects of morphine mixed with naloxone. Each response on the active lever resulted in an injection of 0.02 $\mu$l. During the morphine sessions, this volume contained 0.2 $\mu$g of the opiate; during the sessions of morphine and naloxone, this volume contained 0.2 $\mu$g morphine mixed with 0.2 $\mu$g naloxone. The results show that self-administration was induced and maintained when morphine was injected inside the nucleus accumbens, not in an area outside this region but at the same brain level. The rate of responding on the active lever for morphine was higher than for artificial cerebrospinal fluid and it showed a pattern of gradual increase over time. In contrast, the rate of responding on the inactive lever during the morphine sessions showed a decline. This pattern was not evident in these animals during control sessions and in the animals in which the injections were outside the n. accumbens. These results are interpreted to indicate that the n. accumbens may be part of a system of structures mediating the reinforcing effects of opiates.},

abstract = {Background Brain dopamine neurons code rewarding environmental stimuli by releasing endogenous dopamine, a transmission signal that is important for reinforcement learning. Human reward-seeking gambling behavior, and especially pathological gambling, has been presumed to be modulated by brain dopamine. Methods Striatal dopamine release was studied with [11C]raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) during gambling with an ecologically valid slot machine gambling task. Twenty-four males with and without pathological gambling (DSM-IV) were scanned three times, and the effects of different gambling outcomes (high-reward and low-reward vs. control task) on dopamine release were evaluated. Results Striatal dopamine was released in both groups during high-reward but also low-reward tasks. The dopamine release during the low-reward task was located in the associative part of the caudate nucleus. During the high-reward task, the effect was also seen in the ventral striatum and the magnitude of dopamine release was associated with parallel gambling “high”. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between dopamine release during the low-reward and the high-reward task. There was no general difference in the magnitude of dopamine release between pathological gamblers and controls. However, in pathological gamblers, dopamine release correlated positively with gambling symptom severity. Conclusions Striatal dopamine is released during gambling irrespective of gambling outcome suggesting that the mere expectation/prediction of reward is sufficient to induce dopaminergic changes. Although dopamine release during slot machine gambling is comparable between healthy controls and pathological gamblers, greater gambling symptom severity is associated with greater dopaminergic responses. Thus, as the dopamine reward deficiency theory predicts blunted mesolimbic dopamine responses to gambling in addicted individuals, our results question the validity of the reward deficiency hypothesis in pathological gambling.},

@article{Boileau2003,
abstract = {Abstract Microdialysis experiments in rodents indicate that ethanol promotes dopamine release predominantly in the nucleus accumbens, a phenomenon that is implicated in the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis in humans that an oral dose of ethanol would lead to dopamine release in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens. Six healthy subjects underwent two [11C]raclopride PET scans following either alcohol (1 ml/kg) in orange juice or orange juice alone. Subjective mood changes, heart rate, and blood-alcohol levels were monitored throughout the procedure. Personality traits were evaluated using the tridimensional personality questionnaire. PET images were co-registered with MRI and transformed into stereotaxic space. Statistical parametric maps of [11C]raclopride binding potential change were generated. There was a significant reduction in [11C]raclopride binding potential bilaterally in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens in the alcohol condition compared to the orange juice condition, indicative of increased extracellular dopamine. Moreover, the magnitude of the change in [11C]raclopride binding correlated with the alcohol-induced increase in heart rate, which is thought to be a marker of the psychostimulant effects of the drug, and with the personality dimension of impulsiveness. The present study is the first report that, in humans, alcohol promotes dopamine release in the brain, with a preferential effect in the ventral striatum. These findings support the hypothesis that mesolimbic dopamine activation is a common property of abused substances, possibly mediating their reinforcing effects.

abstract = {Abstract Cocaine use leads to addiction in only a subset of individuals. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these individual differences in the transition from cocaine use to cocaine abuse is important to develop treatment strategies. There is agreement that specific behavioural traits increase the risk for addiction. As such, both high impulsivity and high anxiety have been reported to predict (compulsive) cocaine self-administration behaviour. Here, we set out a new view explaining how these two behavioural traits may affect addictive behaviour. According to psychological and psychiatric evolutionary views, organisms flourish well when they fit (match) their environment by trait and genotype. However, under non-fit conditions, the need to compensate the failure to deal with this environment increases, and, as a consequence, the functional use of rewarding drugs like cocaine may also increase. It suggests that neither impulsivity nor anxiety are bad per se, but that the increased risk to develop cocaine addiction is dependent on whether behavioural traits are adaptive or maladaptive in the environment to which the animals are exposed. This ?behavioural (mal)adaptation view? on individual differences in vulnerability to cocaine addiction may help to improve therapies for addiction.},

Given prior research on aberrant reinforcement learning in affective disorders, this study examines how social anxiety affects probabilistic social reinforcement learning and dynamic updating of learned probabilities in a volatile environment. Two hundred and twenty-two online participants completed questionnaires and a computerized ball-catching game with changing probabilities of reward and punishment. Dynamic learning rates were estimated to assess the relative importance ascribed to new information in response to volatility. Mixed-effects regression was used to analyze throw patterns as a function of social anxiety symptoms. Higher social anxiety predicted fewer throws to the previously punishing avatar and different learning rates after certain role changes, suggesting that social anxiety may be characterized by difficulty updating learned social probabilities. Socially anxious individuals may miss the chance to learn that a once-punishing situation no longer poses a threat.},

Activation in the posterior cingulate cortex was correlated with visual spatial expectancy, defined as the degree to which the valid cue benefited performance as evidenced by faster reaction times compared to non-directional cues. Winning and losing money enhanced this relationship via overlapping but independent limbic mechanisms. In addition, activity in the inferior parietal lobule was correlated with disengagement (the degree to which invalid cues diminished performance). This relationship was also enhanced by monetary incentives. Finally, incentive enhanced the relationship of activation in the visual cortex to visual spatial expectancy and disengagement for both types of incentive (WIN and LOSE). These results show that abstract incentives enhance neural processing within the attention network in a process- and valence-selective manner. They also show that different cognitive and motivational mechanisms may produce a common effect upon unimodal cortices in order to enhance processing to serve the current behavioral goal.},

I present a temporal model that describes and predicts processes and responses at three stages of reactions to ostracism: (a) reflexive, (b) reflective, and (c) resignation. The reflexive pain response triggers threats to four fundamental needs and directs the individual's attention to reflect on the meaning and importance of the ostracism episode, leading to coping responses that serve to fortify the threatened need(s). Persistent exposure to ostracism over time depletes the resources necessary to motivate the individual to fortify threatened needs, thus leading eventually to resignation, alienation, helplessness, and depression. I conclude with a call for more research, especially on the effects of ostracism on groups, and on possible buffering mechanisms that reduce the long-term negative consequences of ostracism.

The results show that being ostracized affected both groups at the immediate test, and that the high socially anxious participants recovered their primary needs more slowly. The results also show that being ostracized affects personality/attractiveness ratings of sources of ostracism, and increases the likelihood of interpreting ambiguous situations in a threatening manner. Overall, the study illustrates that a comprehensive understanding of ostracism, and the effects of moderating factors such as social anxiety, requires assessing the effects across time rather than only focusing on immediate reactions.

abstract = {A broad set of neural circuits, including the amygdala and frontal-striatal systems, has been implicated in mediating learning from gains and losses. The ventral striatum (VS) has been implicated in several aspects of this process. Here, we examined the specific contribution of the VS to learning from gains vs. losses. We found that the VS plays a role in learning to choose between two options that vary in gains but plays no role in learning to choose between two options when one or both is associated with a loss. Computational modeling supported this by showing that animals with VS lesions specifically learned slowly when choosing between gains but not losses.Adaptive behavior requires animals to learn from experience. Ideally, learning should both promote choices that lead to rewards and reduce choices that lead to losses. Because the ventral striatum (VS) contains neurons that respond to aversive stimuli and aversive stimuli can drive dopamine release in the VS, it is possible that the VS contributes to learning about aversive outcomes, including losses. However, other work suggests that the VS may play a specific role in learning to choose among rewards, with other systems mediating learning from aversive outcomes. To examine the role of the VS in learning from gains and losses, we compared the performance of macaque monkeys with VS lesions and unoperated controls on a reinforcement learning task. In the task, the monkeys gained or lost tokens, which were periodically cashed out for juice, as outcomes for choices. They learned over trials to choose cues associated with gains, and not choose cues associated with losses. We found that monkeys with VS lesions had a deficit in learning to choose between cues that differed in reward magnitude. By contrast, monkeys with VS lesions performed as well as controls when choices involved a potential loss. We also fit reinforcement learning models to the behavior and compared learning rates between groups. Relative to controls, the monkeys with VS lesions had reduced learning rates for gain cues. Therefore, in this task, the VS plays a specific role in learning to choose between rewarding options.},

abstract = {The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical element of the mesocorticolimbic system, a brain circuit implicated in reward and motivation. This basal forebrain structure receives dopamine (DA) input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and glutamate (GLU) input from regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMG), and hippocampus (HIP). As such, it integrates inputs from limbic and cortical regions, linking motivation with action. The NAc has a well-established role in mediating the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse and natural rewards such as food and sexual behavior. However, accumulating pharmacological, molecular, and electrophysiological evidence has raised the possibility that it also plays an important (and sometimes underappreciated) role in mediating aversive states. Here we review evidence that rewarding and aversive states are encoded in the activity of NAc medium spiny GABAergic neurons, which account for the vast majority of the neurons in this region. While admittedly simple, this working hypothesis is testable using combinations of available and emerging technologies, including electrophysiology, genetic engineering, and functional brain imaging. A deeper understanding of the basic neurobiology of mood states will facilitate the development of well-tolerated medications that treat and prevent addiction and other conditions (e.g., mood disorders) associated with dysregulation of brain motivation systems.},

abstract = {Microdialysis studies in animals have shown that addictive drugs preferentially increase extracellular dopamine (DA) in the n. accumbens (NAc). Brain imaging studies, while extending these finding to humans, have shown a correlation between psychostimulant-induced increase of extracellular DA in the striatum and self-reported measures of liking and ‘high' (euphoria). Although a correlate of drug reward independent from associative learning and performance is difficult to obtain in animals, conditioned taste avoidance (CTA) might meet these requirements. Addictive drugs induce CTA to saccharin most likely as a result of anticipatory contrast of saccharin over drug reward. Consistently with a role of DA in drug reward, D2 or combined D1/D2 receptor blockade abolishes cocaine, amphetamine and nicotine CTA. Intracranial self-administration studies with mixtures of D1 and D2 receptor agonists point to the NAc shell as the critical site of DA reward. NAc shell DA acting on D1 receptors is also involved in Pavlovian learning through pre-trial and post-trial consolidation mechanisms and in the utilization of spatial short-term memory for goal-directed behavior. Stimulation of NAc shell DA transmission by addictive drugs is shared by a natural reward like food but lacks its adaptive properties (habituation and inhibition by predictive stimuli). These peculiarities of drug-induced stimulation of DA transmission in the NAc shell result in striking differences in the impact of drug-conditioned stimuli on DA transmission. It is speculated that drug addiction results from the impact exerted on behavior by the abnormal DA stimulant properties acquired by drug-conditioned stimuli as a result of their association with addictive drugs.},

Pain also resulted in greater preference for immediate (smaller) over future (larger) monetary rewards. We interpret these results as a motivation to offset the aversive, pain-induced state, where monetary rewards become more appealing under pain than under no pain and when delivered sooner rather than later. Our findings add to the long-standing debate regarding the role of intuition and reflection in decision making.},

We manipulated the uncertainty of outcomes in the task; specifically, we compared a condition with high predictability of reward/punishment (contingent-reward condition) and a condition with low predictability of reward/punishment (random-reward condition). The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was commonly activated in both conditions. Compared with the contingent-reward condition, the orbitofrontal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and dorsal striatum were activated in the random-reward condition, where subjects had to continue to seek contingency between stimuli and reward/punishment. Activation of these brain regions correlated with a positive component of ERPs locked to feedback signals (feedback-related positivity), which showed an association with behavioral decision-making in the contingent-reward condition. Furthermore, cardiovascular responses were attenuated in the random-reward condition, where continuous attention and contingency monitoring were needed, and such attenuation of cardiovascular responses was mediated by vagal activity that was governed by the rostral ACC. These findings suggest that the prefrontal-striatal network provides a neural basis for decision-making and modulation over the peripheral autonomic activity accompanying decision-making.},

However, it is necessary for complete descriptions of more complex forms to use hierarchical indices reflecting global and local characteristics. In this study, we clarified what geometrical properties contributed to complexity and similarity judgments of novel shapes, and examined differences between the two judgments, using Fourier descriptors as a form property, and symmetropy as a structural property. Global and local unevenness were derived from the amplitude of Fourier descriptors, and the hierarchical representation was found in both judgment data. Whereas complexity judgment was based on local unevenness and global symmetry, similarity judgment was, it was suggested, mainly based on global unevenness and symmetry. Moreover, it became clear that geometrical properties important for complexity data were a subset of those for similarity data. These results suggested that more dimensions in geometrical properties were necessary for similarity judgment than complexity judgment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Dopamine medication used by patients with Parkinson's disease has previously been linked to behavioural changes during learning as well as to adjustments in value-based decision-making after learning. To date, however, little is known about the specific relationship between dopaminergic medication-driven differences during learning and subsequent changes in approach/avoidance tendencies in individual patients. Twenty-four Parkinson's disease patients ON and OFF dopaminergic medication and 24 healthy controls subjects underwent functional MRI while performing a probabilistic reinforcement learning experiment. During learning, dopaminergic medication reduced an overemphasis on negative outcomes. Medication reduced negative (but not positive) outcome learning rates, while concurrent striatal blood oxygen level-dependent responses showed reduced prediction error sensitivity. Medication-induced shifts in negative learning rates were predictive of changes in approach/avoidance choice patterns after learning, and these changes were accompanied by systematic striatal blood oxygen level-dependent response alterations. These findings elucidate the role of dopamine-driven learning differences in Parkinson's disease, and show how these changes during learning impact subsequent value-based decision-making.},

abstract = {Cognition can reveal itself in the pupil, as latent cognitive processes map onto specific pupil responses. For instance, the pupil dilates when we make decisions and these pupil size fluctuations reflect decision-making computations during and after a choice. Surprisingly little is known, however, about how pupil responses relate to decisions driven by the learned value of stimuli. This understanding is important, as most real-life decisions are guided by the outcomes of earlier choices. The goal of this study was to investigate which cognitive processes the pupil reflects during value-based decision-making. We used a reinforcement learning task to study pupil responses during value-based decisions and subsequent decision evaluations, employing computational modeling to quantitatively describe the underlying cognitive processes. We found that the pupil closely tracks reinforcement learning processes independently across participants and across trials. Prior to choice, the pupil dilated as a function of trial-by-trial fluctuations in value beliefs about the to-be chosen option and predicted an individual's tendency to exploit high value options. After feedback a biphasic pupil response was observed, the amplitude of which correlated with participants' learning rates. Furthermore, across trials, early feedback-related dilation scaled with value uncertainty, whereas later constriction scaled with signed reward prediction errors. These findings show that pupil size fluctuations can provide detailed information about the computations underlying value-based decisions and the subsequent updating of value beliefs. As these processes are affected in a host of psychiatric disorders, our results indicate that pupillometry can be used as an accessible tool to non-invasively study the processes underlying ongoing reinforcement learning in the clinic.},

The self-categorization explanation of influence grounded in group norms, moderated by group identification, is compared and contrasted to other normative explanations of influence, notably the concept of injunctive norms and the relation to moral conviction. A range of moderating factors relating to individual variation, features of the intragroup and intergroup context, and important contextual variables (i.e., anonymity versus visibility, isolation versus copresence) that are particularly relevant to online influence in the new media are also reviewed.},

abstract = {Self-regulation is a core aspect of human functioning that helps facilitate the successful pursuit of personal goals. There has been a proliferation of theories and models describing different aspects of self-regulation both within and outside of psychology. All of these models provide insights about self-regulation, but sometimes they talk past each other, make only shallow contributions, or make contributions that are underappreciated by scholars working in adjacent areas. The purpose of this article is to integrate across the many different models in order to refine the vast literature on self-regulation. To achieve this objective, we first review some of the more prominent models of self-regulation coming from social psychology, personality psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. We then integrate across these models based on four key elements?level of analysis, conflict, emotion, and cognitive functioning?specifically identifying points of convergence but also points of insufficient emphasis. We close with prescriptions for future research.},

abstract = {When individuals experience empathy, they often seek to bolster others? well-being. But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on cases in which improving others? well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range?including sometimes worsening targets? affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being?that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.},

Research aimed at understanding the consequences of life change has primarily focused on the important roles played by stress, social support, individual differences, and broader socioeconomic factors in shaping health outcomes, most notably mental health decline. In this review we extend these accounts by exploring social identity?based determinants of adjustment to life change. We do so by drawing on social identity theorizing and, in particular, the Social Identity Model of Identity Change (SIMIC). This points to the importance of multiple, maintained, new, and compatible group memberships as determinants of people's responses and adjustment to life change. We apply this model to understand the health consequences of adjustment to life change in four diverse areas: pursuit of higher education, migration, trauma and resilience, and recovery from illness and injury. Finally, we provide direction for future research on SIMIC and the health consequences of life change.},

abstract = {The ways that couples form and manage their intimate relationships at higher and lower levels of socioeconomic status (SES) have been diverging steadily over the past several decades. At higher SES levels, couples postpone marriage and childbirth to invest in education and careers, but they eventually marry at high rates and have relatively low risk for divorce. At lower SES levels, couples are more likely to cohabit and give birth prior to marriage and less likely to marry at all. This review examines how SES comes to be associated with the formation, development, and dissolution of intimate relationships. Overall, research has highlighted how a couple's socioeconomic context facilitates some choices and constrains others, resulting in different capacities for relationship maintenance and different adaptive mating strategies for more and less advantaged couples. A generalizable relationship science requires research that acknowledges these differences and one that recruits, describes, and attends to socioeconomic diversity across couples.},

We focus on two key populations: children in early childhood (from birth to age 6) and parents in early adulthood (in their 20s and early 30s). We posit that mastery of three sets of developmental tasks for each generation?academic/language skills, self-regulation/mental health, and parent-child relationship?will lead to improved educational outcomes for both. Taken as a whole, the dual developmental science framework integrates theory and research on single-generation development (i.e., children or parents) with dynamic and bidirectional theories about the interdependence of children and parents over time.We conclude the review by evaluating existing education interventions and research using the dual developmental science framework, and we discuss opportunities for innovation.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning and decision-making (RLDM) provide a quantitative framework and computational theories, with which we can disentangle psychiatric conditions into basic dimensions of neurocognitive functioning. RLDM offer a novel approach to assess and potentially diagnose psychiatric patients, and there is growing enthusiasm on RLDM and Computational Psychiatry among clinical researchers. Such a framework can also provide insights into the brain substrates of particular RLDM processes as exemplified by model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG). However, many researchers often find the approach too technical and have difficulty adopting it for their research. Thus, there remains a critical need to develop a user-friendly tool for the wide dissemination of computational psychiatric methods. We introduce an R package called hBayesDM (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks), which offers computational modeling on an array of RLDM tasks and social exchange games. The hBayesDM package offers state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian modeling, where both individual and group parameters (i.e., posterior distributions) are estimated simultaneously in a mutually constraining fashion. At the same time, it is extremely user-friendly: users can perform computational modeling, output visualization, and Bayesian model comparisons–each with a single line of coding. Users can also extract trial-by-trial latent variables (e.g., prediction errors) required for model-based fMRI/EEG. With the hBayesDM package, we anticipate that anyone with minimal knowledge of programming can take advantage of cutting-edge computational modeling approaches and investigate the underlying processes of and interactions between multiple decision-making (e.g., goal-directed, habitual, and Pavlovian) systems. In this way, it is our expectation that the hBayesDM package will contribute to the dissemination of advanced modeling approaches and enable a wide range of researchers to easily perform computational psychiatric research within their populations.},

However, this mediation effect is inconsistent and depends on the type of addiction. We investigated if the loss of control mediated the relationship between low social connections and addiction, by integrating different addictive behaviors. Our results demonstrated that experiences of exclusion from others and rejection from society predicted a higher degree of addiction-related problems Integrating and analyzing different addictions demonstrate the mediation effect of loss of control over addiction. These results suggest that the mediation effects of loss of control between low social connection and addiction-related problems are observed when addictive behaviors are integrated.

During the training in each experiment, participants learned to locate a target in 1 of 25 objects arranged in a 5 × 5 grid, using two differently colored, arrow-shaped (Experiments 1 and 2) or asymmetrically shaped (Experiment 3) landmarks placed adjacent to the goal and pointing to the goal location. The absolute location and directions of the landmarks varied across trials, but the constant configuration of the goal and the landmarks enabled participants to find the goal using both global configural information and local vector information (pointing to the goal by each individual landmark). On subsequent test trials, the direction was changed for one of the landmarks to conflict with the global configural information. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that participants used vector information from a single landmark but not configural information. Further examinations revealed that the use of global (metric) information was enhanced remarkably by goal searching with nonarrow-shaped landmarks on the computer monitor (Experiment 3) but much less so with arrow-shaped landmarks (Experiment 2). The General Discussion focuses on a comparison between humans in the current study and pigeons in the previous study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Dopaminergic projections are hypothesized to stabilize neural signaling and neural representations, but how they shape regional information processing and large-scale network interactions remains unclear. Here we investigated effects of lowered dopamine levels on within-region temporal signal variability (measured by sample entropy) and between-region functional connectivity (measured by pairwise temporal correlations) in the healthy brain at rest. The acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) method was used to decrease dopamine synthesis in 51 healthy participants who underwent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. Functional connectivity and regional signal variability were estimated for each participant. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to statistically assess changes in signal variability following APTD as compared with the balanced control treatment. The analysis captured a pattern of increased regional signal variability following dopamine depletion. Changes in hemodynamic signal variability were concomitant with changes in functional connectivity, such that nodes with greatest increase in signal variability following dopamine depletion also experienced greatest decrease in functional connectivity. Our results suggest that dopamine may act to stabilize neural signaling, particularly in networks related to motor function and orienting attention towards behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Moreover, dopamine-dependent signal variability is critically associated with functional embedding of individual areas in large-scale networks.},

@article{Bailey2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a substantial literature on the neurobiology of reading and dyslexia. Differences are often described in terms of individual regions or individual cognitive processes. However, there is a growing appreciation that the brain areas subserving reading are nested within larger functional systems, and new network analysis methods may provide greater insight into how reading difficulty arises. Yet, relatively few studies have adopted a principled network-based approach (e.g., connectomics) to studying reading. In this study, we combine data from previous reading literature, connectomics studies, and original data to investigate the relationship between network architecture and reading. METHODS: First, we detailed the distribution of reading-related areas across many resting-state networks using meta-analytic data from NeuroSynth. Then, we tested whether individual differences in modularity, the brain's tendency to segregate into resting-state networks, are related to reading skill. Finally, we determined whether brain areas that function atypically in dyslexia, as identified by previous meta-analyses, tend to be concentrated in hub regions. RESULTS: We found that most resting-state networks contributed to the reading network, including those subserving domain-general cognitive skills such as attention and executive function. There was also a positive relationship between the global modularity of an individual's brain network and reading skill, with the visual, default mode and cingulo-opercular networks showing the highest correlations. Brain areas implicated in dyslexia were also significantly more likely to have a higher participation coefficient (connect to multiple resting-state networks) than other areas. CONCLUSIONS: These results contribute to the growing literature on the relationship between reading and brain network architecture. They suggest that an efficient network organization, i.e., one in which brain areas form cohesive resting-state networks, is important for skilled reading, and that dyslexia can be characterized by abnormal functioning of hub regions that map information between multiple systems. Overall, use of a connectomics framework opens up new possibilities for investigating reading difficulty, especially its commonalities across other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

The dysfunctions reflect (a) decreased sensitivity of reward circuits, (b) enhanced sensitivity of memory circuits to conditioned expectations to drugs and drug cues, stress reactivity, and (c) negative mood, and a weakened control circuit. Although initial experimentation with a drug of abuse is largely a voluntary behavior, continued drug use can eventually impair neuronal circuits in the brain that are involved in free will, turning drug use into an automatic compulsive behavior. The ability of addictive drugs to co-opt neurotransmitter signals between neurons (including dopamine, glutamate, and GABA) modifies the function of different neuronal circuits, which begin to falter at different stages of an addiction trajectory. Upon exposure to the drug, drug cues or stress this results in unrestrained hyperactivation of the motivation/drive circuit that results in the compulsive drug intake that characterizes addiction.},

abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

abstract = {Despite intensive scientific investigation and public health imperatives, drug addiction treatment outcomes have not significantly improved in more than 50years. Non-invasive brain imaging has, over the past several decades, contributed important new insights into the neuroplastic adaptations that result from chronic drug intake, but additional experimental approaches and neurobiological hypotheses are needed to better capture the totality of the motivational, affective, cognitive, genetic and pharmacological complexities of the disease. Recent advances in assessing network dynamics through resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) may allow for such systems-level assessments. In this review, we first summarize the nascent addiction-related rsFC literature and suggest that in using this tool, circuit connectivity may inform specific neurobiological substrates underlying psychological dysfunctions associated with reward, affective and cognitive processing often observed in drug addicts. Using nicotine addiction as an exemplar, we subsequently provide a heuristic framework to guide future research by linking recent findings from intrinsic network connectivity studies with those interrogating nicotine's neuropharmacological actions. Emerging evidence supports a critical role for the insula in nicotine addiction. Likewise, the anterior insula, potentially together with the anterior cingulate cortex, appears to pivotally influence the dynamics between large-scale brain networks subserving internal (default-mode network) and external (executive control network) information processing. We suggest that a better understanding of how the insula modulates the interaction between these networks is critical for elucidating both the cognitive impairments often associated with withdrawal and the performance-enhancing effects of nicotine administration. Such an understanding may be usefully applied in the design and development of novel smoking cessation treatments.},

abstract = {The evaluation of the individual “fingerprint” of a human functional connectome (FC) is becoming a promising avenue for neuroscientific research, due to its enormous potential inherent to drawing single subject inferences from functional connectivity profiles. Here we show that the individual fingerprint of a human functional connectome can be maximized from a reconstruction procedure based on group-wise decomposition in a finite number of brain connectivity modes. We use data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that the optimal reconstruction of the individual FCs through connectivity eigenmodes maximizes subject identifiability across resting-state and all seven tasks evaluated. The identifiability of the optimally reconstructed individual connectivity profiles increases both at the global and edgewise level, also when the reconstruction is imposed on additional functional data of the subjects. Furthermore, reconstructed FC data provide more robust associations with task-behavioral measurements. Finally, we extend this approach to also map the most task-sensitive functional connections. Results show that is possible to maximize individual fingerprinting in the functional connectivity domain regardless of the task, a crucial next step in the area of brain connectivity towards individualized connectomics.},

@article{Adam2007,
abstract = {An increasing number of people report concerns about the amount of stress in their life. At the same time obesity is an escalating health problem worldwide. Evidence is accumulating rapidly that stress related chronic stimulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and resulting excess glucocorticoid exposure may play a potential role in the development of visceral obesity. Since adequate regulation of energy and food intake under stress is important for survival, it is not surprising that the HPA axis is not only the ‘conductor' of an appropriate stress response, but is also tightly intertwined with the endocrine regulation of appetite. Here we attempt to link animal and human literatures to tease apart how different types of psychological stress affect eating. We propose a theoretical model of Reward Based Stress Eating. This model emphasizes the role of cortisol and reward circuitry on motivating calorically dense food intake, and elucidating potential neuroendocrine mediators in the relationship between stress and eating. The addiction literature suggests that the brain reward circuitry may be a key player in stress-induced food intake. Stress as well as palatable food can stimulate endogenous opioid release. In turn, opioid release appears to be part of an organisms' powerful defense mechanism protecting from the detrimental effects of stress by decreasing activity of the HPA axis and thus attenuating the stress response. Repeated stimulation of the reward pathways through either stress induced HPA stimulation, intake of highly palatable food or both, may lead to neurobiological adaptations that promote the compulsive nature of overeating. Cortisol may influence the reward value of food via neuroendocrine/peptide mediators such as leptin, insulin and neuropeptide Y (NPY). Whereas glucocorticoids are antagonized by insulin and leptin acutely, under chronic stress, that finely balanced system is dysregulated, possibly contributing to increased food intake and visceral fat accumulation. While these mechanisms are only starting to be elucidated in humans, it appears the obesity epidemic may be exacerbated by the preponderance of chronic stress, unsuccessful attempts at food restriction, and their independent and possibly synergistic effects on increasing the reward value of highly palatable food.},

abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to develop a self-diagnostic scale that could distinguish smartphone addicts based on the Korean self-diagnostic program for Internet addiction (K-scale) and the smartphone's own features. In addition, the reliability and validity of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS) was demonstrated. Methods A total of 197 participants were selected from Nov. 2011 to Jan. 2012 to accomplish a set of questionnaires, including SAS, K-scale, modified Kimberly Young Internet addiction test (Y-scale), visual analogue scale (VAS), and substance dependence and abuse diagnosis of DSM-IV. There were 64 males and 133 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years (M = 26.06; SD = 5.96). Factor analysis, internal-consistency test, t-test, ANOVA, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of SAS. Results Based on the factor analysis results, the subscale “disturbance of reality testing” was removed, and six factors were left. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of SAS were verified (Cronbach's alpha = 0.967). SAS and its subscales were significantly correlated with K-scale and Y-scale. The VAS of each factor also showed a significant correlation with each subscale. In addition, differences were found in the job (p<0.05), education (p<0.05), and self-reported smartphone addiction scores (p<0.001) in SAS. Conclusions This study developed the first scale of the smartphone addiction aspect of the diagnostic manual. This scale was proven to be relatively reliable and valid.},

abstract = {Aging is related to cognitive decline, and it has been reported that aging disrupts some resting state brain networks. However, most studies have focused on the default mode network and ignored other resting state networks. In this study, we measured resting state activity using fMRI and explored whether cognitive decline with aging is related to disrupted resting state networks. Independent component analysis was used to evaluate functional connectivity. Notably, the connectivity within the salience network that consisted of the bilateral insula and the anterior cingulated cortex decreased with aging; the impairment of functional connectivity was correlated with measured decreases in individual cognitive abilities. Furthermore, certain internetwork connectivities (salience to auditory, default mode to visual, etc.) also decreased with aging. These results suggest that (1) aging affects not only the default mode network but also other networks, specifically the salience network; (2) aging affects internetwork connectivity; and (3) disruption of the salience network is related to cognitive decline in elderly people.},

abstract = {Parallels in biological, psychological, and behavioral systems have led to the hypothesis that an addictive process may contribute to problematic eating. The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) was developed to provide a validated measure of addictive-like eating behavior based upon the diagnostic criteria for substance dependence. Recently, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM–5) was released, which included significant changes to the substance-related and addictive disorders (SRAD) section. In the current study, the YFAS 2.0 was developed to maintain consistency with the current diagnostic understanding of addiction and to improve the psychometric properties of the original YFAS. In a sample of 550 participants, 14.6% met criteria for food addiction. The YFAS 2.0 demonstrated good internal consistency, as well as convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. Elevated scores on the YFAS 2.0 were associated with higher rates of obesity and more severe pathological eating (e.g., binge eating). The YFAS 2.0 also appeared to capture a related, but unique construct relative to traditional eating disorders. In a separate sample of 209 participants, the YFAS and YFAS 2.0 were directly compared. Both versions of the YFAS were similarly associated with elevated body mass index, binge eating, and weight cycling. However, exceeding the food addiction threshold was more strongly associated with obesity for the YFAS 2.0 than the original YFAS. Thus, the YFAS 2.0 appears to by a psychometrically sound measure that reflects the current diagnostic understanding of addiction to further investigate the potential role of an addictive process in problematic eating behavior.

abstract = {Alcohol-dependence is associated with cognitive and biological alterations, and also with interpersonal impairments. Although overwhelming in clinical settings and involved in relapse, these social impairments have received little attention from researchers. Particularly, brain alterations related to social exclusion have not been explored in alcohol-dependence. Our primary purpose was to determine the neural correlates of social exclusion feelings in this population. In all, 44 participants (22 abstinent alcohol-dependent patients and 22 paired controls) played a virtual game (‘cyberball') during fMRI recording. They were first included by other players, then excluded, and finally re-included. Brain areas involved in social exclusion were identified and the functional connectivity between these areas was explored using psycho-physiological interactions (PPI). Results showed that while both groups presented dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activations during social exclusion, alcohol-dependent participants exhibited increased insula and reduced frontal activations (in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) as compared with controls. Alcohol-dependence was also associated with persistent dACC and parahippocampal gyrus activations in re-inclusion. PPI analyses showed reduced frontocingulate connectivity during social exclusion in alcohol-dependence. Alcohol-dependence is thus linked with increased activation in areas eliciting social exclusion feelings (dACC–insula), and with impaired ability to inhibit these feelings (indexed by reduced frontal activations). Altered frontal regulation thus appears implied in the interpersonal alterations observed in alcohol-dependence, which seem reinforced by impaired frontocingulate connectivity. This first exploration of the neural correlates of interpersonal problems in alcohol-dependence could initiate the development of a social neuroscience of addictive states.},

abstract = {Aim: To describe social characteristics seen among socially excluded drug users in 10 cities from 9 European countries, and identify which social exclusion indicators (i.e. housing, employment, education) are most closely linked to intravenous drug use. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Interviews were held in social services centers, town halls, streets, squares and other usual meeting points of the target population. Participants: The sample comprises 1,879 participants who have used heroin and/or cocaine and certain derivatives (92.3%) over the last year. Males accounted for 69.7% of the sample, and the mean age was 30.19 years. Participants were recruited in 10 cities: Seville and Granada, Spain; Cologne, Germany; Vienna, Austria; Brussels, Belgium; Athens, Greece; Dublin, Ireland; London, England; Lisbon, Portugal, and Perugia, Italy. Measurements: Structured face-to-face questionnaire, conducted by privileged access interviewers. Results: Cannabis, heroin and cocaine are the most widely used substances. In the total sample, 60.2% injected drugs during the last year, 45.9% reported having hepatitis C; 54.9% have been in prison; 14.2% are homeless; 11.3% have a regular job, and 35.2% are involved in illegal activities. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis (injectors and non-injectors) showed that older participants have a greater likelihood of injecting than younger ones. Social exclusion variables associated with intravenous drug use are incarceration, homelessness, irregular employment, and delinquency. Participants who abandoned or were expelled from a drug treatment program are at greater risk of injecting drugs than participants who have never had treatment, are currently in treatment or have been released. Conclusion: Personal, social, and economic conditions are all linked in a process of social exclusion that compounds problem drug misuse. Given the findings of this study, we believe that there is a clear need for specific programs targeting specific groups, i.e., distinct strategies must be set in place, in line with the profile and needs of the patient in each context.},

Participants entered treatment between June 2006 and July 2007 and completed a 12-month follow-up survey by telephone (n=787). The results of the OLS regression analysis indicate that individuals with greater social exclusion factors (e.g. greater economic hardship, lower subjective social standing, greater perceived discrimination), lower perceived control of one's life, and lower self-regulation had higher perceived stress. Furthermore, a significant interaction was found suggesting a stress-buffering effect of personal control between subjective social standing and perceived stress. Interestingly, income status was not significantly related to perceived stress, while economic hardship, which assesses participants' inability to meet basic expenses, was significantly associated with perceived stress. Future research should examine how to integrate the AA/NA teaching about powerlessness and its role in recovery with the importance of increased personal control and self-control in decreasing perceived stress.

abstract = {The development of drug taking from controlled intake to drug addiction was studied by means of an animal model. Outbred rats had continous free access to water and drinking fluids containing different concentrations of a drug for 7–9 months. After an abstinence period of 4–9 months, the drug was offered again (retest). Previous ethological classification of each rat and changes of housing conditions were used to study the modifiability of drug taking. With ethanol and the $\mu$-agonistic opiate etonitazene, two stages followed each other. Controlled drug intake was adjusted to situational and individual variables. Social isolation of the rats raised the intake of ethanol and opiate. Dominant rats took less drugs than subordinate ones, but, in contrast to the latter, increased drug consumption after social disturbances. The adjustment of drug taking to social variables, was accompanied by changes in the dopaminergic and GABAA-ergic neurotransmission and by altered responses to acute drug administrations. Further, place preference, associated with reinforcing stimuli was modulated by subchronic sensitization/desensitization of dopaminergic transmission. Controlled drug intake lasted for 6–8 months, after which a spontaneous increase of drug consumption was found which latently continued during abstinence periods of 1 month. In the retest after abstinence, drug intake of these rats was strongly increased compared with both their previous consumption and that of drug-naive controls. Since drug taking could no longer be modulated by gustatory, environmental or individual factors (loss of control), it was considered as addictive. Addiction appeared to be specific to the kind of the drug. It persisted for the rest of the rat's life. After long periods of abstinence, ethanol-addicted rats revealed a completely altered pattern of response to self-administered alcohol compared with controlled drinkers. Their dopaminergic D1-transmission was irreversibly altered. Drug addiction only developed when the rat had free choice between water and drug-containing solutions. Long-term forced administration of ethanol or opiate, only led to physical dependence bot not to addiction. Some applications of the animal model are discussed, concerning the assessment of risk factors, the intake of drug combinations, residual neurochemical changes and concepts of treatment.},

A cross-lagged panel survey of 361 college students in Hong Kong was conducted. Results show that excessive and unhealthy Internet use would increase feelings of loneliness over time. Although depression had a moderate and positive bivariate relationship with Internet addiction at each time point, such a relationship was not significant in the cross-lagged analyses. This study also found that online social contacts with friends and family were not an effective alternative for offline social interactions in reducing feelings of loneliness. Furthermore, while an increase in face-to-face contacts could help to reduce symptoms of Internet addiction, this effect may be neutralized by the increase in online social contacts as a result of excessive Internet use. Taken as a whole, findings from the study show a worrisome vicious cycle between loneliness and Internet addiction.},

abstract = {The nature of addiction is often debated along moral versus biological lines. However, recent advances in neuroscience offer insights that might help bridge the gap between these opposing views. Current evidence shows that most drugs of abuse exert their initial reinforcing effects by inducing dopamine surges in limbic regions, affecting other neurotransmitter systems and leading to characteristic plastic adaptations. Importantly, there seem to be intimate relationships between the circuits disrupted by abused drugs and those that underlie self-control. Significant changes can be detected in circuits implicated in reward, motivation and/or drive, salience attribution, inhibitory control and memory consolidation. Therefore, addiction treatments should attempt to reduce the rewarding properties of drugs while enhancing those of alternative reinforcers, inhibit conditioned memories and strengthen cognitive control. We posit that the time has come to recognize that the process of addiction erodes the same neural scaffolds that enable self-control and appropriate decision making.},

abstract = {The endogenous opioid system, which alleviates physical pain, is also known to regulate social distress and reward in animal models. To test this hypothesis in humans (n=18), we used an $\mu$-opioid receptor (MOR) radiotracer to measure changes in MOR availability in vivo with positron emission tomography during social rejection (not being liked by others) and acceptance (being liked by others). Social rejection significantly activated the MOR system (i.e., reduced receptor availability relative to baseline) in the ventral striatum, amygdala, midline thalamus and periaqueductal gray (PAG). This pattern of activation is consistent with the hypothesis that the endogenous opioids have a role in reducing the experience of social pain. Greater trait resiliency was positively correlated with MOR activation during rejection in the amygdala, PAG and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), suggesting that MOR activation in these areas is protective or adaptive. In addition, MOR activation in the pregenual ACC was correlated with reduced negative affect during rejection. In contrast, social acceptance resulted in MOR activation in the amygdala and anterior insula, and MOR deactivation in the midline thalamus and sgACC. In the left ventral striatum, MOR activation during acceptance predicted a greater desire for social interaction, suggesting a role for the MOR system in social reward. The ventral striatum, amygdala, midline thalamus, PAG, anterior insula and ACC are rich in MORs and comprise a pathway by which social cues may influence mood and motivation. MOR regulation of this pathway may preserve and promote emotional well being in the social environment.},

abstract = {Abstract Nutritional state (e.g. fasted vs. fed) and different food stimuli (e.g. high-calorie vs. low-calorie, or appetizing vs. bland foods) are both recognized to change activity in brain reward systems. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we have studied the interaction between nutritional state and different food stimuli on brain food reward systems. We examined how blood oxygen level-dependent activity within a priori regions of interest varied while viewing pictures of high-calorie and low-calorie foods. Pictures of non-food household objects were included as control stimuli. During scanning, subjects rated the appeal of each picture. Twenty non-obese healthy adults [body mass index 22.1?±?0.5?kg/m2 (mean?±?SEM), age range 19?35?years, 10 male] were scanned on two separate mornings between 11:00 and 12:00?h, once after eating a filling breakfast (?fed?: 1.6?±?0.1?h since breakfast), and once after an overnight fast but skipping breakfast (?fasted?: 15.9?±?0.3?h since supper) in a randomized cross-over design. Fasting selectively increased activation to pictures of high-calorie over low-calorie foods in the ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior insula, and medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Furthermore, fasting enhanced the subjective appeal of high-calorie more than low-calorie foods, and the change in appeal bias towards high-calorie foods was positively correlated with medial and lateral OFC activation. These results demonstrate an interaction between homeostatic and hedonic aspects of feeding behaviour, with fasting biasing brain reward systems towards high-calorie foods.},

abstract = {Difficulty waiting plays a primary role in symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in particular, impulsivity. Current theories suggest that relatively strong preferences for small immediate rewards as observed in ADHD-Combined type are the result of delay-related negative feelings. However, the measurement of difficulty waiting is typically limited to objective choices between small immediate and large delayed rewards. This study aimed at extending the measurement of difficulty waiting in ADHD-Combined type with ratings about subjective feelings. Children and adolescents (ages 6-17) with ADHD-Combined type (n=25), ADHD-Inattentive type (n=20) and matched typically developing participants (n=37) performed temporal reward discounting tasks, and completed a Visual Analogue Scale of subjectively experienced ease/difficulty waiting. Although those with ADHD-Combined type demonstrated relatively steep temporal reward discounting, as reported elsewhere (Scheres et al., 2010), there were no group differences for subjectively experienced ease/difficulty waiting. Additionally, correlations between subjective and objective measures of difficulty waiting were significantly higher in the ADHD-Combined type group than in the control group. These findings suggest that (a) those with ADHD-Combined type do not choose impulsively because they have more negative feelings about waiting than controls; (b) choices in the ADHD-Combined type group are more in accordance with/driven by their feelings than choices made by participants in the control group.},

We show that the effect of both heroin and heroin-related visual cues are maximally expressed in the sites of origin of ascending midbrain neuromodulatory systems.

abstract = {In what ways are we similar to our friends? Here, we characterized the social network of residents of a remote village, a subset of whom contributed personality and neuroimaging data. We demonstrate that similarity in individuals' resting-state functional connectomes predicts individuals' proximity in their real-world social network, even when controlling for demographic characteristics and self-reported personality traits. Our results suggest that patterns of functional brain activity during rest encode latent similarities (e.g., in terms of how people think and behave) that are associated with friendship. Taken together, integrating neuroimaging and social network analysis can offer novel insights into how the brain shapes or is shaped by the social networks that it inhabits.People often have the intuition that they are similar to their friends, yet evidence for homophily (being friends with similar others) based on self-reported personality is inconsistent. Functional connectomes—patterns of spontaneous synchronization across the brain—are stable within individuals and predict how people tend to think and behave. Thus, they may capture interindividual variability in latent traits that are particularly similar among friends but that might elude self-report. Here, we examined interpersonal similarity in functional connectivity at rest—that is, in the absence of external stimuli—and tested if functional connectome similarity is associated with proximity in a real-world social network. The social network of a remote village was reconstructed; a subset of residents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Similarity in functional connectomes was positively related to social network proximity, particularly in the default mode network. Controlling for similarities in demographic and personality data (the Big Five personality traits) yielded similar results. Thus, functional connectomes may capture latent interpersonal similarities between friends that are not fully captured by commonly used demographic or personality measures. The localization of these results suggests how friends may be particularly similar to one another. Additionally, geographic proximity moderated the relationship between neural similarity and social network proximity, suggesting that such associations are particularly strong among people who live particularly close to one another. These findings suggest that social connectivity is reflected in signatures of brain functional connectivity, consistent with the common intuition that friends share similarities that go beyond, for example, demographic similarities.Anonymized fMRI, social network, and questionnaire data and code used for analyses have been deposited in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/rhhyon/KSHAP-PNAS-2020).},

abstract = {Experiences of social exclusion, including ostracism and rejection, can last anywhere from a few seconds to many years. Most research focused on short-term social exclusion, whereas virtually no empirical work has investigated the experiences of long-term social exclusion. Williams theorized that prolonged experiences of social exclusion (i.e., ostracism) would cause individuals to pass from the reflexive and reflective stages to the resignation stage characterized by the inability to recover threatened psychological needs and feelings of alienation, unworthiness, helplessness, and depression. Across two studies, we explored this prediction—and, in light of pain overlap theories, considered the possibility that chronic exclusion and chronic pain induce common psychological responses. Study 1 consisted of a quasi-experimental study involving five groups of participants: (1) those with chronic experiences of social exclusion (n = 82), (2) those with chronic physical pain (n = 82), (3) those with chronic hypertension (n = 69), (4) those with chronic kidney disease (n = 60), and (5) a group of healthy people (n = 83). Participants filled out a questionnaire including measures of need threat, negative emotions, and the four key outcomes linked to the resignation stage (i.e., alienation, unworthiness, helplessness, and depression). Although our data showed little evidence to support the psychological overlap between chronic exclusion and chronic physical pain, the results suggested that chronic experiences of social exclusion were associated with higher levels of negative emotions and resignation stage outcomes compared to participants in all the other groups. Furthermore, we found that threatened psychological needs mediated the effect of social exclusion on the resignation stage outcomes. Study 2 tested, but found no support for, the possibility that acute experiences of social exclusion could increase the resignation stage outcomes. Overall, our research indicates that when people are exposed to short-term exclusion, they recover their threatened psychological needs. However, when enduring chronic social exclusion, they do not, and enter the resignation stage.},

Here we challenge this notion by identifying distinct multivariate fMRI patterns unique to pain and rejection. Sixty participants experience painful heat and warmth and view photos of ex-partners and friends on separate trials. FMRI pattern classifiers discriminate pain and rejection from their respective control conditions in out-of-sample individuals with 92% and 80% accuracy. The rejection classifier performs at chance on pain, and vice versa. Pain- and rejection-related representations are uncorrelated within regions thought to encode pain affect (for example, dorsal anterior cingulate) and show distinct functional connectivity with other regions in a separate resting-state data set (N=91). These findings demonstrate that separate representations underlie pain and rejection despite common fMRI activity at the gross anatomical level. Rather than co-opting pain circuitry, rejection involves distinct affective representations in humans.},

Using positron emission tomography, we demonstrated that D2/3 receptor availability is significantly reduced in the nucleus accumbens of impulsive rats that were never exposed to cocaine and that such effects are independent of DA release.

This causes there to be no logical line of deduction between definition and measurement and, along with other problems in the approach, renders the statistics produced invalid.},

abstract = {When people are forced to be isolated from each other, do they crave social interactions? To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural responses evoked by food and social cues after participants (n = 40) experienced 10 h of mandated fasting or total social isolation. After isolation, people felt lonely and craved social interaction. Midbrain regions showed selective activation to food cues after fasting and to social cues after isolation; these responses were correlated with self-reported craving. By contrast, striatal and cortical regions differentiated between craving food and craving social interaction. Across deprivation sessions, we found that deprivation narrows and focuses the brain's motivational responses to the deprived target. Our results support the intuitive idea that acute isolation causes social craving, similar to the way fasting causes hunger.},

abstract = {Social exclusion is a distressing experience and can lead to both retaliatory and prosocial reactions toward the sources of exclusion. The way people react to social exclusion has been hypothesized to be shaped through chronic exposure to peer rejection. This functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study examined associations between chronic peer rejection and retaliatory (i.e. punishing) and prosocial (i.e. forgiving) reactions to social exclusion and the neural processes underlying them. Chronically rejected (n = 19) and stably highly accepted adolescents (n = 27) distributed money between themselves and unknown others who previously included or excluded them in a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Decreasing the excluders' monetary profits (i.e., punishment) was associated with increased activity in the ventral striatum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal cortex in both groups. Compared to stably highly accepted adolescents, chronically rejected adolescents exhibited higher activity in the dorsal striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex - brain regions implicated in cognitive control - when they refrained from punishment and shared their money equally with (i.e. forgave) the excluders. These results provide insights into processes that might underlie the maintenance of peer rejection across development, such as difficulties controlling the urge to retaliate after exclusion.},

abstract = {Why do some people take risks and live for the present, whereas others avoid risks and save for the future? The evolutionary framework of life history theory predicts that preferences for risk and delay in gratification should be influenced by mortality and resource scarcity. A series of experiments examined how mortality cues influenced decisions involving risk preference (e.g., $10 for sure vs. 50% chance of $20) and temporal discounting (e.g., $5 now vs. $10 later). The effect of mortality depended critically on whether people grew up in a relatively resource-scarce or resource-plentiful environment. For individuals who grew up relatively poor, mortality cues led them to value the present and gamble for big immediate rewards. Conversely, for individuals who grew up relatively wealthy, mortality cues led them to value the future and avoid risky gambles. Overall, mortality cues appear to propel individuals toward diverging life history strategies as a function of childhood socioeconomic status, suggesting important implications for how environmental factors influence economic decisions and risky behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

We therefore investigated presynaptic dopaminergic function in 6 female FMS patients in comparison to 8 age- and gender-matched controls as assessed by positron emission tomography with 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA as a tracer. Semiquantitative analysis revealed reductions in 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA uptake in several brain regions, indicating a disruption of presynaptic dopamine activity wherein dopamine plays a putative role in natural analgesia. Although the small sample size makes these findings preliminary, it appears that FMS might be characterized by a disruption of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Perspective An association between FMS and reduced dopamine metabolism within the pain neuromatrix provides important insights into the pathophysiology of this mysterious disorder.},

abstract = {Pain and reward are opponent, interacting processes. Such interactions are enabled by neuroanatomical and neurochemical overlaps of brain systems that process pain and reward. Cerebral processing of hedonic (‘liking') and motivational (‘wanting') aspects of reward can be separated: the orbitofrontal cortex and opioids play an important role for the hedonic experience, and the ventral striatum and dopamine predominantly process motivation for reward. Supported by neuroimaging studies, we present here the hypothesis that the orbitofrontal cortex and opioids are responsible for pain modulation by hedonic experience, while the ventral striatum and dopamine mediate motivational effects on pain. A rewarding stimulus that appears to be particularly important in the context of pain is pain relief. Further, reward, including pain relief, leads to operant learning, which can affect pain sensitivity. Indirect evidence points at brain mechanisms that might underlie pain relief as a reward and related operant learning but studies are scarce. Investigating the cerebral systems underlying pain–reward interactions as well as related operant learning holds the potential of better understanding mechanisms that contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain, as detailed in the last section of this review.},

This has complicated the use of $\mu$-agonists in the treatment of chronic pain. However, clinical studies show that when $\mu$-agonist analgesics are appropriately used to control pain, actual abuse or addiction does not usually occur, although some risk factors that increase vulnerability need to be considered, including genetic variation. We review recent findings on molecular adaptations in sustained pain models, and propose how these adaptations (including sustained release of the endogenous $\mu$-agonist $\beta$-endorphin) can result in decreased abuse potential of $\mu$-agonists in chronic pain states. We also review data on particular gene polymorphisms (e.g. in the $\mu$-receptor gene) that could also influence the relative abuse potential of $\mu$-agonists in clinical pain populations.},

In contrast, chronic pain does not serve this function and instead only provides a persistent sensation of pain and a negative experience. The mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been recognized to play a central role in motivated behaviors, including various types of reward and pleasure. Many dopaminergic neurons may release multiple neurotransmitters, and the physiological role of the co-release of these transmitters has been revealed incrementally. However, it was not yet clear whether the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and small molecules released in the nucleus accumbens (N.Acc.), the input region of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons, are involved in pain modulation. Recently, we revealed that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and small molecules released in the N.Acc. could contribute to pain modulation. In this review, we provide an overview of the relationship between pain and the brain reward circuit using a combination of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and in vivo microdialysis/mass spectrometry integrated system.},

Current treatments of SB are mainly based on pharmacological treatments that are not specific of SB (e.g. antidepressants), and new therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Recent data strengthen the ancient conception pain (social, psychic, physical) that is at the core of the suicidal process and should be incorporated in the clinical assessment of suicide risk. Then, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of pain may open new avenues regarding therapeutic perspectives. Opiates appear to be a promising candidate in treatment of SB. Indeed, since the last two decades, growing evidences suggest an implication of the opioid system in the pathophysiology of SB, this conduct to the elaboration of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using opiates in patients with SB. Results suggesting an anti-suicidal effect of buprenorphine and the potential opioidergic-related anti-suicidal effect of ketamine both contribute to the growing interest in opiates use in SB. In this review, we will summarize a large part of the evidence that leads researchers and clinicians to be interested in the use of opiates for SB treatment and discuss on new opioid pharmacological options for suicidal patients.},

This deactivation was reflected by increases in µ-opioid receptor availability in vivo. The deactivation of µ-opioid neurotransmission in the rostral anterior cingulate, ventral pallidum, and amygdala was correlated with the increases in negative affect ratings and the reductions in positive affect ratings during the sustained sadness state.These data demonstrate dynamic changes in µ-opioid neurotransmission in response to an experimentally induced negative affective state.

@article{Martin2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is associated with several sensory abnormalities, including allodynia as well as spontaneous pain. Opioid intake in neuropathic pain patients is motivated by alleviation of both pain and allodynia. However, laboratory animal studies rely almost exclusively on reflexive withdrawal measures of allodynia. The authors examined the pharmacology of self-regulated intake of opioids in rats with or without nerve injury and compared the rate of drug intake to reversal of allodynia. METHODS: Rats were implanted with intravenous catheters, and the L5 and L6 spinal nerves were ligated in half of these animals. Rats were then trained to self-administer a commonly abused opioid (heroin) and commonly prescribed opioids (morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, and methadone). In addition, rats trained to self-administer heroin were given either clonidine or adenosine spinally before self-administration sessions to assess opioid-sparing effects. RESULTS: Nerve injury significantly decreased the reinforcing effects of low doses of opioids, and only doses of each opioid that reduced mechanical hypersensitivity maintained self-administration after spinal nerve ligation. The rate of drug consumption was correlated with the duration of the antiallodynic effect for each dose of opioid. Intrathecal administration of clonidine or adenosine reversed mechanical hypersensitivity, but only clonidine reduced heroin self-administration in rats with spinal nerve ligation. CONCLUSION: Opioid self-administration is significantly altered by nerve injury, with rate of drug intake being correlated with reversal of allodynia. Intrathecal clonidine, but not adenosine, produces opioid-sparing effects in self-administering rats. The neurobiologic mechanisms that regulate opioid consumption in rats therefore seem to be altered after nerve injury. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.},

Recent evidence suggests: that the important functions that are classically associated with the PAG - defensive reactions, analgesia and autonomic regulation - are integrated by overlapping longitudinal columns of neurons; and that different classes of threatening or nociceptive stimuli trigger distinct co-ordinated patterns of skeletal, autonomic and antinociceptive adjustments by selectively targeting specific PAG columnar circuits. These findings call for a fundamental revision in our concept of the organization of the PAG, and a recognition of the special roles played by different longitudinal PAG columns in co-ordinating distinct strategies for coping with different types of stress, threat and pain.},

Optical stimulation of ventromedial thalamic axon terminals in prefrontal cortical areas in mouse brain slices evokes responses in corticocortical, corticothalamic and layer I inhibitory interneurons. Using anterograde tracing techniques and immunohistochemistry in male Sprague–Dawley rats, we provide anatomical evidence that ventromedial thalamic axon terminals in prelimbic cortex make contacts onto pyramidal neurons and, in particular, onto corticostriatal neurons as well as layer I inhibitory interneurons. Using stereology, we made quantitative estimates of contacts in uppermost prelimbic layer I onto dendrites of pyramidal neurons, corticostriatal neurons and layer I inhibitory interneurons. Prefrontal cortex has long been associated with decision making. Specifically, corticostriatal neurons in rat prelimbic cortex play an important role in cost–benefit decision making. Although recent experiments have detailed the physiology of this area in thalamocortical circuits, the extent of the impact of ventromedial thalamic input on corticostriatal neurons or layer I inhibitory interneurons has not been explored. Our quantitative anatomical results provide evidence that most ventromedial thalamic input to pyramidal neurons is provided to corticostriatal neurons and that overall more contacts are made onto the population of excitatory than onto the population of inhibitory neurons.},

Less is known about how these experiences shape social processes and neural circuitry. In this study, we thus investigated how ELS affects children's perception of, and neural response to, negative social experiences in a social exclusion paradigm (Cyberball). Method Twenty-five foster or adopted children with ELS (age 10.6 ± 1.8 years, 13 male and 12 female) and 26 matched nonseparated controls (age 10.38 ± 1.7 years, 12 male and 14 female) took part in a Cyberball paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results During peer rejection, children with ELS reported significantly more feelings of exclusion and frustration than nonseparated controls. On the neural level, children with ELS showed reduced activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and reduced connectivity between dlPFC-dACC, areas previously implicated in affect regulation. Conversely, children with ELS showed increased neural activation in brain regions involved in memory, arousal, and threat-related processing (middle temporal gyrus, thalamus, ventral tegmental area) relative to controls during social exclusion. The number of separation experiences before entering the permanent family predicted reductions in fronto-cingulate recruitment. The relationship between early separations and self-reported exclusion was mediated by dlPFC activity. Conclusion The findings suggest that ELS leads to alterations in neural circuitry implicated in the regulation of socioemotional processes. This neural signature may underlie foster children's differential reactivity to rejection in everyday life and could increase risk for developing affective disorders.},

Increases in signal were observed in the sublenticular extended amygdala of the basal forebrain (SLEA) and the ventral tegmentum/periaqueductal gray (VT/PAG), while foci of increased signal and decreased signal were observed in the ventral striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Early and late phases were observed for signals in most brain regions, with early activation in reward related regions such as the SLEA, VT/PAG, and ventral striatum. In contrast, structures associated with somatosensory perception, including SI somatosensory cortex, thalamus, and insula, showed delayed activation. These data support the notion that there may be a shared neural system for evaluation of aversive and rewarding stimuli.},

abstract = {Cortical mechanisms that regulate acute or chronic pain remain poorly understood. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) exerts crucial control of sensory and affective behaviors. Recent studies show that activation of the projections from the PFC to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important pathway in the brain's reward circuitry, can produce inhibition of both sensory and affective components of pain. However, it is unclear whether this circuit is endogenously engaged in pain regulation. To answer this question, we disrupted this circuit using an optogenetic strategy. We expressed halorhodopsin in pyramidal neurons from the PFC, and then selectively inhibited the axonal projection from these neurons to neurons in the NAc core. Our results reveal that inhibition of the PFC or its projection to the NAc, heightens both sensory and affective symptoms of acute pain in na{\"{i}}ve rats. Inhibition of this corticostriatal pathway also increased nociceptive sensitivity and the aversive response in a chronic neuropathic pain model. Finally, corticostriatal inhibition resulted in a similar aversive phenotype as chronic pain. These results strongly suggest that the projection from the PFC to the NAc plays an important role in endogenous pain regulation, and its impairment contributes to the pathology of chronic pain.},

abstract = {Opioids interact with systems processing pain and social stimuli. Both systems are crucial for responding to strains of everyday life and both are linked to relapse risk in opioid-dependent patients. The investigation of those systems seems essential to better understand opioid addiction as a whole. 17 patients on opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) and 21 healthy individuals underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) social ball-tossing (Cyberball) paradigm simulating social inclusion and exclusion. In addition, painful and non-painful temperature stimuli were applied, in order to test pain sensitivity. Patients on OMT showed reduced pain sensitivity. Subjective pain was higher after social exclusion compared to social inclusion trials. In comparison to healthy controls, OMT patients felt less included and more excluded during inclusion and control conditions, and equally excluded during the social exclusion condition. Feelings of exclusion during the inclusion trials were associated with higher scores on the childhood trauma questionnaire. Across all conditions, OMT patients demonstrated decreased fMRI activation in the bilateral superior and middle occipital and bilateral cunei, the lingual gyri, as well as in the left fusiform gyrus (whole brain FWE-corrected). Comparing social exclusion and inclusion conditions, healthy individuals showed significant activation in brain areas related to social feedback and emotion processing, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula and fusiform gyrus, whereas OMT patients showed no difference across conditions. As negative social affect is a potential trigger for relapse, patients might benefit from therapeutic strategies that enhance social integration.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity can be heavily impacted not only by basic threats to survival but also by threats to social bonds. In this study we explored the behavioral and physiological consequences of social exclusion/inclusion in patients with psoriasis, a disease frequently associated with the experience of being ostracized and with deficient emotion regulation skills. We employed a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball) to induce the experience of social exclusion/inclusion. We then used a Trust Game to measure the effects of this social modulation on trust. During Cyberball, infrared thermal imaging was used to record participants' facial temperature and thus obtain an online measure of SNS activation. Behavioral data showed that social exclusion shifted participants' trust toward unfamiliar players who had not previously excluded them. Physiological data indicated that in control participants, social exclusion triggered higher SNS activation than inclusion. No such effect was found in patients with psoriasis, whose SNS activity was the same during inclusion as it was during exclusion, suggesting that they benefit less from inclusive experiences than control participants. In addition, in patients but not in controls, higher SNS activation during social exclusion was linked to higher monetary investment toward unfamiliar players, a result in keeping with the social reconnection hypothesis, according to which emotions triggered by social rejection can be regulated by investing in new social interactions. We also found that an increase in periorbital temperature is accompanied by a decrease in happiness ratings after social exclusion was experienced during the Cyberball game. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous research on emotional processes in psoriasis has mainly employed self-report measures. In this study we used thermal imaging to obtain an online measure of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity during social exclusion and tested how this experience influenced subsequent trust. We found that being included was a less positive experience for patients compared with controls and that SNS activity during exclusion had a stronger influence on subsequent trust in patients than in controls.},

abstract = {Cross-species affective neuroscience studies confirm that primary-process emotional feelings are organized within primitive subcortical regions of the brain that are anatomically, neurochemically, and functionally homologous in all mammals that have been studied. Emotional feelings (affects) are intrinsic values that inform animals how they are faring in the quest to survive. The various positive affects indicate that animals are returning to "comfort zones" that support survival, and negative affects reflect "discomfort zones" that indicate that animals are in situations that may impair survival. They are ancestral tools for living--evolutionary memories of such importance that they were coded into the genome in rough form (as primary brain processes), which are refined by basic learning mechanisms (secondary processes) as well as by higher-order cognitions/thoughts (tertiary processes). To understand why depression feels horrible, we must fathom the affective infrastructure of the mammalian brain. Advances in our understanding of the nature of primary-process emotional affects can promote the development of better preclinical models of psychiatric disorders and thereby also allow clinicians new and useful ways to understand the foundational aspects of their clients' problems. These networks are of clear importance for understanding psychiatric disorders and advancing psychiatric practice.},

abstract = {Summary Rodent studies have demonstrated the role of the mesoaccumbal circuit in reinforcement-based learning. Importantly, however, while phasic activity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contributes to reinforcement learning, rodent evidence suggests that slow changes in tonic VTA activity and associated accumbal dopamine release help regulate motivational behavior. Nonetheless, the consequences of sustained blockage of the mesoaccumbal circuit for motivation and reinforcement learning have not yet been examined in primates. Using a double-infection viral vector technique, we demonstrate that selective, unidirectional, and reversible blockage of the primarily dopaminergic mesoaccumbal circuit in monkeys increased network-level functional connectivity, especially in fronto-temporal cortex. These global network changes were not associated with deficits in reinforcement learning during an object discrimination reversal task. In contrast, sustained mesoaccumbal inactivation greatly reduced motivation for performing a motivation-based decision-making task. Thus, the mesoaccumbal pathway in primates is critical for high-effort motivation but not for all forms of reinforcement-based learning.},

Since that time it has enjoyed widespread use by both health workers and alcohol researchers.

abstract = {Abuse of prescription opioid analgesics in non-medical context has been on the rise over the past decade. The most commonly abused analgesic in this drug class consists of a combined formulation of hydrocodone and acetaminophen. The present study was aimed to determine the rewarding effects of hydrocodone, acetaminophen, and their combination using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Using a 6-day CPP paradigm, rats were paired with hydrocodone (0.5, 1.0 or 5.0mg/kg) or acetaminophen (50, 100 or 300mg/kg) to determine whether the drugs given alone would produce a CPP. Rats conditioned with the highest dose of hydrocodone exhibited place preference, whereas rats conditioned with acetaminophen did not demonstrate place preference. In a second experiment, varying doses of hydrocodone and acetaminophen were combined to determine whether acetaminophen would enhance hydrocodone reward. Acetaminophen (100mg/kg) enhanced the rewarding effects of hydrocodone (1mg/kg), although the effect was unique to this particular dose combination. Higher or lower doses of acetaminophen combined with hydrocodone did not alter hydrocodone CPP. The present findings suggest that acetaminophen has a limited potential of modulating the rewarding properties of hydrocodone in rats.},

abstract = {The integration of external and internal bodily signals provides a coherent, multisensory experience of one's own body. The ability to accurately detect internal bodily sensations is referred to as interoceptive accuracy (IAcc). Previous studies found that IAcc can be increased when people with low IAcc engage in self-processing such as when looking in the mirror or at a photograph of one's own face. However, the way the self is represented changes depending on the context. Specifically, in social situations, the self is experienced in relation to significant others and not as an isolated individual. Intriguingly, in a relational context romantic partners can be used as social mirrors for one's self. We here investigated whether directing one's attention to romantic partners would enhance one's IAcc, similar to the effect of self-face observation when the self is processed in isolation. During a heartbeat counting task, both concurrent self-face and partner-face observation improved accuracy in those with initially low IAcc; however, this improvement was significantly greater for the partner's face. These results suggest that significant others may play an important role in determining the quality of one's self-awareness. Given that high interoceptive awareness is linked to better emotion regulation, increased IAcc during partner observation is likely to have an adaptive role in maintaining stable and secure romantic relationships through greater emotion regulation.

abstract = {Background Inflammation rapidly impairs mood and cognition and, when severe, can appear indistinguishable from major depression. These sickness responses are characterized by an acute reorientation of motivational state; pleasurable activities are avoided, and sensitivity to negative stimuli is enhanced. However, it remains unclear how these rapid shifts in behavior are mediated within the brain. Methods Here, we combined computational modeling of choice behavior, experimentally induced inflammation, and functional brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to describe these mechanisms. Using a double-blind, randomized crossover study design, 24 healthy volunteers completed a probabilistic instrumental learning task on two separate occasions, one 3 hours after typhoid vaccination and one 3 hours after saline (placebo) injection. Participants learned to select high probability reward (win {\pounds}1) and avoid high probability punishment (lose {\pounds}1) stimuli. An action-value learning algorithm was fit to the observed behavior, then used within functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses to identify neural coding of prediction error signals driving motivational learning. Results Inflammation acutely biased behavior, enhancing punishment compared with reward sensitivity, through distinct actions on neural representations of reward and punishment prediction errors within the ventral striatum and anterior insula. Consequently, choice options leading to potential rewards were less behaviorally attractive, and those leading to punishments were more aversive. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the neural mediation of a rapid, state-dependent reorientation of reward versus punishment sensitivity during inflammation. This mechanism may aid the adaptive reallocation of metabolic resources during acute sickness but might also account for maladaptive, motivational changes that underpin the association between chronic inflammation and depression.},

This article shows that this cognitive-affective processing disposition undermines intimate relationships. Study 1 describes a measure that operationalizes the anxious-expectations component of rejection sensitivity. Study 2 provides experimental evidence that people who anxiously expect rejection readily perceive intentional rejection in the ambiguous behavior of others. Study 3 shows that people who enter romantic relationships with anxious expectations of rejection readily perceive intentional rejection in the insensitive behavior of their new partners. Study 4 demonstrates that rejection-sensitive people and their romantic partners are dissatisfied with their relationships. Rejection-sensitive men's jealousy and rejection-sensitive women's hostility and diminished supportiveness help explain their partners' dissatisfaction.

abstract = {The discovery of endogenous opioids has markedly influenced the research on the biology of addiction and reward brain processes. Evidence has been presented that these brain substances modulate brain stimulation reward, self-administration of different drugs of abuse, sexual behaviour and social behaviour. There appears to be two different domains in which endogenous opioids, present in separate and distinct brain regions, are involved. One is related to the modulation of incentive motivational processes and the other to the performance of certain behaviours. It is concluded that endogenous opioids may play a role in the vulnerability to certain diseases, such as addiction and autism, but also when the disease is present, such as alcoholism.},

abstract = {Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is a brain region that subserves cognition and motor control, but the mechanisms of these functions remain unknown. Human neuroimaging and monkey electrophysiology studies have provided valuable insights, but it has been difficult to link the two literatures. Based on monkey single-unit recordings, we hypothesized that human dACC is comprised of a mixture of functionally distinct cells that variously anticipate and detect targets, indicate novelty, influence motor responses, encode reward values, and signal errors. As an initial test of this conceptualization, the current event-related functional MRI study used a reward-based decision-making task to isolate responses from a subpopulation of dACC cells sensitive to reward reduction. As predicted, seven of eight subjects showed significant (P &lt; 10−4) dACC activation when contrasting reduced reward (REDrew) trials to fixation (FIX). Confirmatory group analyses then corroborated the predicted ordinal relationships of functional MRI activation expected during each trial type (REDrew &gt; SWITCH &gt; CONrew ≥ FIX). The data support a role for dACC in reward-based decision making, and by linking the human and monkey literatures, provide initial support for the existence of heterogeneity within dACC. These findings should be of interest to those studying reward, cognition, emotion, motivation, and motor control.∥ ACC,anterior cingulate cortex;dACC,dorsal ACC, fMRI, functional MRI;CMAr,rostral cingulate motor area;REDrew,reduced reward;CONrew,constant reward, FIX, fixation;RT,reaction time;ROI,region of interest},

abstract = {The endogenous opioid system supports a multitude of functions related to appetitive behaviour and feeding in humans and animals, and it has been proposed to support hedonic aspects of feeding thus contributing to development of obesity. Here we used positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate whether feeding results in hedonia-dependent endogenous opioid release in humans. Ten healthy males were recruited for the study. They were scanned with mu-opioid specific ligand [11C]carfentanil three times: following a palatable meal, a non-palatable meal, and after an overnight fast. Subjective mood, satiety, and circulating hormones were measured. Feeding induced significant endogenous opioid release throughout the brain. This response was more pronounced following non-palatable versus palatable meal, and independent of the subjective hedonic responses to feeding. We conclude that feeding consistently triggers cerebral opioid release even in the absence of subjective pleasure associated with feeding, suggesting that metabolic and homeostatic rather than exclusively hedonic responses play a role in the feeding-triggered cerebral opioid release.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEndogenous opioid system supports both hedonic and homeostatic functions. It has been proposed that overeating and concomitant opioid release could downregulate opioid receptors and promote development of obesity. However, it remains unresoleved whether feeding leads to endogenous opioid release in humans. We used in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) to test whether feeding triggers cerebral opioid release and whether this response is associated with pleasurable sensations. We scanned volunteers using mu-opioid receptor specific radioligand [11C]carfentanil three times: After an overnight fast, after consuming a palatable meal, and after consuming a non-palatable meal. Feeding led to significant endogenous opioid release, and this occurred also in the absence of feeding-triggered hedonia. Feeding-triggered opioid release thus also reflects metabolic and homeostatic rather than exclusively hedonic responses.},

abstract = {The field of social cognitive neuroscience has been at the forefront of study for many psychologists over the past decade or so. Much of the spur for this new field has come from the development of functional neuro-imaging techniques, making possible unobtrusive measurement of brain activation over time. Now we are able to ask such questions as: are there regions of the brain in the inferior temporal cortex dedicated to face processing? There are many other such intractable questions that we can ask now that we could not even imagine asking thirty years ago. This book is interested in questions such as: How do we understand and represent other people? How do we represent social groups? How do we regulate our emotions and offer socially undesirable responses? This book is divided into four sections. The first deals with understanding and representing other people. The second deals with representing social groups. The third section deals with the interplay of cognition and emotion in social regulation. The final section considers a range of questions that have emerged in the context of social neuroscience research.},

abstract = {Social pain after exclusion by others activates brain regions also involved in physical pain. Here we evaluated whether monetary reward could compensate for the negative feeling of social pain in the brain. To address this question we used the unique technique of intracranial electroencephalography in subjects with drug resistant epilepsy. Specifically, we recorded theta activity from intracranial electrodes implanted in the insular cortex while subjects experienced conditions of social inclusion and exclusion associated with monetary gain and loss. Our study confirmed that theta rhythm in the insular cortex is the neural signature of social exclusion. We found that while monetary gain suppresses the effect of social pain in the anterior insula, there is no such effect in the posterior insula. These results imply that the anterior insula can use secondary reward signals to compensate for the negative feeling of social pain. Hence, here we propose that the anterior insula plays a pivotal role in integrating contingencies to update social pain feelings. Finally, the possibility to modulate the theta rhythm through the reward system might open new avenues of research for treating pathologies related to social exclusion.},

abstract = {Acute stress elicits redistribution of lymphocyte subsets, especially natural killer (NK) cells, probably for preparatory defense against potential invasion of antigens in fight–flight situations. We previously reported that regulation of lymphocyte redistribution is based on the evaluation of the controllability of a stressor (Kimura, K., Ohira, H., Isowa, T., Matsunaga, M., Murashima, S. 2007. Regulation of lymphocytes redistribution via autonomic nervous activity during stochastic learning. Brain Behav. Immun. 21, 921–934; Ohira, H., Isowa, T., Nomura, M., Ichikawa, N., Kimura, K., Miyakoshi, M., Iidaka, T., Fukuyama, S., Nakajima, T., Yamada, J. 2008. Imaging brain and immune association accompanying cognitive appraisal of an acute stressor. Neuroimage 39, 500–514). Specifially, lymphocyte redistribution is somewhat attenuated when a stressor is uncontrollable, probably to save biological energy in a situation where appropriate coping is unclear. We infer that this phenomenon might reflect top-down regulation over peripheral immune function by higher-ordered brain regions. To investigate the neural basis of such a phenomenon, we simultaneously recorded regional cerebral blood flow using 15O-water positron emission tomography and cardiovascular (blood pressure and heart rate), neuroendocrine (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and adrenocorticotropic hormone), and immune (proportions of NK cells and helper T cells in blood) indices in 16 male subjects who performed a stochastic learning task with manipulation of controllability (controllable vs. uncontrollable). Consistent with previous studies, the proportion of peripheral NK cells was attenuated in an uncontrollable stress condition. The dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices were activated in the uncontrollable situation but not in the controllable condition, and additionally, these prefrontal brain regions significantly correlated with the degree of redistribution of NK cells in the uncontrollable condition. The results of the study suggest these brain regions are involved in both evaluation of the controllability of a stressor and regulation of immune function.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives Rejection sensitivity (RS), attention for depression-relevant stimuli, and interpersonal rejection are established risk factors for depression. RS has previously been associated with increased attention for socially threatening faces, but has not been examined in the context of specifically depression-relevant stimuli. The current study examined whether RS influences attention for emotional facial expressions in the context of social rejection or inclusion. Methods Participants (n = 180) completed a self-report measure of RS and a free viewing eye tracking task before and after an experimental task (Cyberball) in which participants were randomized to be included or rejected. Results Hierarchical linear regressions predicting change in attention to emotional faces revealed significant effects only for sad faces. Higher RS was associated with increased attention for sad faces from pre- to post-Cyberball. Cyberball condition moderated the effect with participants in the rejection condition demonstrating increased attention for sad faces, but with no significant relationship in the inclusion condition. Limitations Our sample had relatively low levels of RS and depression. Conclusions Consistent with interpersonal and cognitive models of depression, we found that RS was associated with increased attention for sad faces when participants were interpersonally rejected. Results provide preliminary evidence that rejection sensitivity may contribute to depression vulnerability via increased attention to depression-relevant information in the context of interpersonal rejection. Further research including clinically depressed participants and using longitudinal approaches are necessary to confirm this potential relationship.},

abstract = {Nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key region in the brain that is integral to both the reward and the emotional systems. The aim of the current paper is to synthesize the basic and the clinical neuroscience discoveries relevant to the NAc for the purpose of two-way translation. Selected literature on the structure and the functionality of the NAc is reviewed across animal and human studies. Dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are the three key neurotransmitters that modulate the reward function and the motor activity. Dissociative roles of the core and the shell of the NAc include getting to the reward and staying on task with discretion, respectively. NAc shows decreased activation to reward in the individuals with major depressive disorder and the bipolar disorder, relative to that healthy controls (HC). The "difficult to please" or insatiability in response to reward in the emotional disorders may possibly be explained by such a neural pattern. Furthermore, it is likely that the increased amygdala activity reported in mood disorders could be accentuating the "wanting" of the reward by the virtue of its connections with the NAc, explaining the potential "hot mess". In contrast, the NAc shows increased reward response in substance use disorders, relative to HC, in response to reward and emotional tasks. Accurate characterization of the NAc and its functionality in the human imaging studies of mood and substance use has important treatment implications.},

abstract = {Prosocial behaviors are essential for social bonding and cohesion, but the mechanisms that underpin these behaviors are still poorly understood. Using computational modeling and neuroimaging, we show that people can learn to benefit others and that this learning is underpinned by reinforcement learning signals in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). However, there is substantial individual variability in people's ability for prosocial learning. More empathic people learn faster and have more selective responses in the sgACC when benefitting others. Our results thus reveal a computational mechanism driving prosocial learning in humans and why empathy and prosocial behavior may be linked. This framework could help to explain reduced empathy and prosocial behavior in people with disorders of social cognition.Reinforcement learning theory powerfully characterizes how we learn to benefit ourselves. In this theory, prediction errors—the difference between a predicted and actual outcome of a choice—drive learning. However, we do not operate in a social vacuum. To behave prosocially we must learn the consequences of our actions for other people. Empathy, the ability to vicariously experience and understand the affect of others, is hypothesized to be a critical facilitator of prosocial behaviors, but the link between empathy and prosocial behavior is still unclear. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) participants chose between different stimuli that were probabilistically associated with rewards for themselves (self), another person (prosocial), or no one (control). Using computational modeling, we show that people can learn to obtain rewards for others but do so more slowly than when learning to obtain rewards for themselves. fMRI revealed that activity in a posterior portion of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain (sgACC) drives learning only when we are acting in a prosocial context and signals a prosocial prediction error conforming to classical principles of reinforcement learning theory. However, there is also substantial variability in the neural and behavioral efficiency of prosocial learning, which is predicted by trait empathy. More empathic people learn more quickly when benefitting others, and their sgACC response is the most selective for prosocial learning. We thus reveal a computational mechanism driving prosocial learning in humans. This framework could provide insights into atypical prosocial behavior in those with disorders of social cognition.},

Only selective core lesions impaired Pavlovian approach. A subsequent experiment studied the effects of a disconnection of the Ant Cing and NAcc core, using an asymmetric lesion procedure, to determine whether these structures interact sequentially as part of a limbic corticostriatal system. Such lesioned rats were also significantly impaired relative to controls at autoshaping.

abstract = {Loneliness is a prevailing experience which is particularly familiar to adolescents and young adults. It is a subjective experience which is influenced by one's personality, life experiences, and situational variables. The present study examined the influence of drug cessation on coping with loneliness. Drug abusers, during their stay in detox centers, were compared to drug abusers who participated in a methadone maintenance program and those two groups were compared to a group of adults in the general population who are non users of drugs. A total of 304 participants volunteered to answer a 34-item yes/no questionnaire, reflecting on their loneliness experiences and how they coped with it. The factors which compose the beneficial coping strategies are: Acceptance and reflection, Self-development and understanding, Social support network, Distancing and denial, Religion and faith, and Increased activity. Results indicated significant differences in the manner in which the three groups cope with loneliness. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {This report contains a review of the literature about the interplay between loneliness and the abuse of alcohol. A theoretical discussion based on clinical observations can be dated back to the 1950's. Systematic empirical studies, however, appear sparsely and have mainly been performed during the last decade. Thus, knowledge is still incomplete, but the review indicates that loneliness may be significant at all stages in the course of alcoholism: as a contributing and maintaining tactor in the growth of abuse and as an encumbrance in attempts to give it up. Concordant reports demonstrate that alcoholics do feel more lonely than members of most other groups do. In advanced abusers, lonelines is obviously connected with a number of negative characteristics and, together with several of those, directly linked to a poor prognosis. There are, however, no obvious relations to the external social situation (i.e. network) or amount of drinking. Instead, the feeling of loneliness appears to be more connected with a general negative perception about oneself and one's relations to other people and also with a general dissatisfaction with most things in life. The lonely abuser seems likewise resigned and unable to bring himself to change his/her situation. There are also associations with a broad array of psychopathology. In comparison to people with other health problems, the supportive value of the social network of alcoholics appears to be more wavering.},

abstract = {The neural processes underlying empathy are a subject of intense interest within the social neurosciences. However, very little is known about how brain empathic responses are modulated by the affective link between individuals. We show here that empathic responses are modulated by learned preferences, a result consistent with economic models of social preferences. We engaged male and female volunteers in an economic game, in which two confederates played fairly or unfairly, and then measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while these same volunteers observed the confederates receiving pain. Both sexes exhibited empathy-related activation in pain-related brain areas (fronto-insular and anterior cingulate cortices) towards fair players. However, these empathy-related responses were significantly reduced in males when observing an unfair person receiving pain. This effect was accompanied by increased activation in reward-related areas, correlated with an expressed desire for revenge. We conclude that in men (at least) empathic responses are shaped by valuation of other people's social behaviour, such that they empathize with fair opponents while favouring the physical punishment of unfair opponents, a finding that echoes recent evidence for altruistic punishment.},

abstract = {Abstract It is suggested that addictive behaviour, so called, fits into a psychological resource model. In other words, the habits in question are acquired because they serve a useful function for the individual, and the nature of the functions they fulfil is related to the personality profile of the ?addict?. For some people this resource function develops into a form of addiction, and it is suggested that the reason this occurs is related to excessive dopamine functioning. This in turn is used to suggest the nature of the addictive personality. Excessive dopamine functioning is related to the personality dimension of psychoticism, and evidence is cited to the effect that psychoticism is closely related to a large number of addictions. The precise reasons for the addictive effects of dopamine are still being debated, but clearly there is a causal chain linking personality and biological factors together in the production of addictive behaviour. ? 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Although the general public appears to have embraced the term ‘videogame addiction', the scientific debate as to whether ‘gaming addiction' can actually be considered an addiction similar to substance addictions of DSM-IV is still unsettled. To date, research on gaming addiction has focused on problematic behavior from the gaming activity itself and there has been little empirical research related to pathological personality patterns that usually are associated with substance addictions. Therefore, the current study examined how game exposure and ‘problematic gaming behavior' are related to personality patterns associated with addiction by means of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2). A large-scale survey study was performed among 1004 adolescent boys (age-range 11–18, M=14.18, SD=1.36) measuring problematic gaming behavior, physical game-related symptoms, gaming behavior and three MMPI-2 subscales measuring personality patterns usually associated with substance addiction (MAC-R, APS, AAS). Results showed that problematic gaming and physical symptoms were positively related to all MMPI-2 subscales, while game exposure was not related to the indirect measures of addictive personality patterns (i.e., MAC-R, APS). Thus, problematic gaming should be clearly distinguished from high game exposure. High game exposure merely indicates enthusiasm for some although it may be psychopathological for others.},

Collateral medical problems include the spread of HIV and hepatitis C virus secondary to i.v. drug abuse and effects on prenatal brain development ( 1). Progress in the understanding of the causes of addictions and its treatment has been impeded by the lack of a unifying biochemical theory. However, recent evidence suggests that some common mechanism might underlie addictions to otherwise apparently unrelated drugs. A major hypothesis has emerged suggesting that the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) might play a central role in the molecular mechanisms of at least some addictions. If so, it would represent an important target for discovery of effective pharmacotherapy and revolutionize the pharmacist?s role in treating addictions. This short overview outlines the status of the theory of a common biochemical mechanism of drug addiction.},

Linkage studies have identified genes that are of both these general types.Treatment and prevention of addictions are partially successful because medical management targets the acute phase of illness and is not individualized.The individualization of treatment and prevention is likely to be advanced by the discovery of genetic predictors of the neurobiological pathways that underlie addiction.},

Patients with Parkinson's disease, who have depleted dopamine in the basal ganglia, are impaired in tasks that require learning from trial and error. Here, we show, using two cognitive procedural learning tasks, that Parkinson's patients off medication are better at learning to avoid choices that lead to negative outcomes than they are at learning from positive outcomes. Dopamine medication reverses this bias, making patients more sensitive to positive than negative outcomes. This pattern was predicted by our biologically based computational model of basal ganglia-dopamine interactions in cognition, which has separate pathways for "Go" and "NoGo" responses that are differentially modulated by positive and negative reinforcement.},

Each competition was based on two experimental datasets: An estimation dataset, and a competition dataset. The studies that generated the two datasets used the same methods and subject pool, and examined decision problems randomly selected from the same distribution. After collecting the experimental data to be used for estimation, the organizers posted them on the Web, together with their fit with several baseline models, and challenged other researchers to compete to predict the results of the second (competition) set of experimental sessions. Fourteen teams responded to the challenge: The last seven authors of this paper are members of the winning teams. The results highlight the robustness of the difference between decisions from description and decisions from experience. The best predictions of decisions from descriptions were obtained with a stochastic variant of prospect theory assuming that the sensitivity to the weighted values decreases with the distance between the cumulative payoff functions. The best predictions of decisions from experience were obtained with models that assume reliance on small samples. Merits and limitations of the competition method are discussed.

abstract = {How similar are the experiences of social rejection and physical pain? Extant research suggests that a network of brain regions that support the affective but not the sensory components of physical pain underlie both experiences. Here we demonstrate that when rejection is powerfully elicited—by having people who recently experienced an unwanted break-up view a photograph of their ex-partner as they think about being rejected—areas that support the sensory components of physical pain (secondary somatosensory cortex; dorsal posterior insula) become active. We demonstrate the overlap between social rejection and physical pain in these areas by comparing both conditions in the same individuals using functional MRI. We further demonstrate the specificity of the secondary somatosensory cortex and dorsal posterior insula activity to physical pain by comparing activated locations in our study with a database of over 500 published studies. Activation in these regions was highly diagnostic of physical pain, with positive predictive values up to 88%. These results give new meaning to the idea that rejection “hurts.” They demonstrate that rejection and physical pain are similar not only in that they are both distressing—they share a common somatosensory representation as well.},

However, only a handful of studies have attempted to assess impulsivity and other impulse-spectrum traits (e.g., sensation seeking) using a variety of behavioral and self-report measures in PGs and few examined the independent impact of SUDs. We compared 30 PGs without SUD histories, 31 PGs with SUD histories and 40 control participants on self-reported impulsivity, delayed discounting, attention/memory, response inhibition, risk taking, sensation seeking and distress tolerance measures. PGs, regardless of SUD history, discounted delayed rewards at greater rates than controls. PGs also reported acting on the spur of the moment, experienced trouble planning and thinking carefully, and noted greater attention difficulties than controls. PGs with SUD took greater risks on a risk-taking task than did PGs without SUD histories, but the two groups did not differ on any other measures of impulsivity. We conclude that PGs are more impulsive than non-problem gamblers in fairly specific ways, but PGs with and without SUD histories differ on few measures. More research should focus on specific ways in which PGs exhibit impulsivity to better address impulsive behaviors in treatment.},

abstract = {In 7 experiments, the authors manipulated social exclusion by telling people that they would end up alone later in life or that other participants had rejected them. Social exclusion caused a substantial reduction in prosocial behavior. Socially excluded people donated less money to a student fund, were unwilling to volunteer for further lab experiments, were less helpful after a mishap, and cooperated less in a mixed-motive game with another student. The results did not vary by cost to the self or by recipient of the help, and results remained significant when the experimenter was unaware of condition. The effect was mediated by feelings of empathy for another person but was not mediated by mood, state self-esteem, belongingness, trust, control, or self-awareness. The implication is that rejection temporarily interferes with emotional responses, thereby impairing the capacity for empathic understanding of others, and as a result, any inclination to help or cooperate with them is undermined.

abstract = {Objective Assess the effect of ostracism and social connection-related activities on adolescents' motivation to eat and their energy intake. Methods Participants (n = 103; M age = 13.6 years) were either ostracized or included when playing a computer game, Cyberball. Next, they wrote about their friend (social-connection), watched television (distraction), or completed Sudoku puzzles (cognitive-load), and then completed a task to earn points toward snack food and/or socializing. Afterwards, participants were given access to food and social activities. Results Ostracized adolescents were more motivated to earn food than adolescents who were in the included/control condition. Follow-up contrasts indicated that ostracized adolescents who wrote about friends worked more for food points and consumed more food than other adolescents. Conclusion Results suggest that social connection-related activities following ostracism may further deplete self-regulatory resources, thereby resulting in increased unhealthy food patterns. Study limitations as well as clinical implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {The mesostriatal dopamine system is prominently implicated in model-free reinforcement learning, with fMRI BOLD signals in ventral striatum notably covarying with model-free prediction errors. However, latent learning and devaluation studies show that behavior also shows hallmarks of model-based planning, and the interaction between model-based and model-free values, prediction errors, and preferences is underexplored. We designed a multistep decision task in which model-based and model-free influences on human choice behavior could be distinguished. By showing that choices reflected both influences we could then test the purity of the ventral striatal BOLD signal as a model-free report. Contrary to expectations, the signal reflected both model-free and model-based predictions in proportions matching those that best explained choice behavior. These results challenge the notion of a separate model-free learner and suggest a more integrated computational architecture for high-level human decision-making.},

abstract = {The neuroscientific investigation of emotions is hindered by a lack of rapid and precise readouts of emotion states in model organisms. Dolensek et al. identified facial expressions as innate and sensitive reflections of the internal emotion state in mice (see the Perspective by Girard and Bellone). Mouse facial expressions evoked by diverse stimuli could be classified into emotionlike categories, similar to basic emotions in humans. Machine-learning algorithms categorized mouse facial expressions objectively and quantitatively at millisecond time scales. Intensity, value, and persistence of subjective emotion states could thus be decoded in individual animals. Combining facial expression analysis with two-photon calcium imaging allowed the identification of single neurons whose activity closely correlated with specific facial expressions in the insular cortex, a brain region implicated in affective experiences in humans.Science, this issue p. 89; see also p. 33Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion relies on objective readouts of the emotional state of an individual, which remains a major challenge especially in animal models. We found that mice exhibit stereotyped facial expressions in response to emotionally salient events, as well as upon targeted manipulations in emotion-relevant neuronal circuits. Facial expressions were classified into distinct categories using machine learning and reflected the changing intrinsic value of the same sensory stimulus encountered under different homeostatic or affective conditions. Facial expressions revealed emotion features such as intensity, valence, and persistence. Two-photon imaging uncovered insular cortical neuron activity that correlated with specific facial expressions and may encode distinct emotions. Facial expressions thus provide a means to infer emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice.},

abstract = {Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at M1/S1 cortex has been shown to alleviate neuropathic pain. Objectives: To investigate the possible neurobiological correlates of cortical neurostimulation for the pain relief. Methods: We studied the effects of M1/S1 rTMS on nociception, brain dopamine D2 and $\mu$-opioid receptors using a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded crossover study design and 3D-positron emission tomography (PET). Ten healthy subjects underwent active and sham rTMS treatments to the right M1/S1 cortex with E-field navigated device. Dopamine D2 and $\mu$-receptor availabilities were assessed with PET radiotracers [11C]raclopride and [11C]carfentanil after each rTMS treatment. Thermal quantitative sensory testing (QST), contact heat evoked potential (CHEP) and blink reflex (BR) recordings were performed between the PET scans. Results: $\mu$-Opioid receptor availability was lower after active than sham rTMS (P ≤ 0.0001) suggested release of endogenous opioids in the right ventral striatum, medial orbitofrontal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, and left insula, superior temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus. There were no differences in striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability between active and sham rTMS, consistent with lack of long-lasting measurable dopamine release. Active rTMS potentiated the dopamine-regulated habituation of the BR compared to sham (P = 0.02). Thermal QST and CHEP remained unchanged after active rTMS. Conclusions: rTMS given to M1/S1 activates the endogenous opioid system in a wide brain network associated with processing of pain and other salient stimuli. Direct enhancement of top-down opioid-mediated inhibition may partly explain the clinical analgesic effects of rTMS. Significance: Neurobiological correlates of rTMS for the pain relief are unclear. rTMS on M1/S1 with 11C-carfentanyl-PET activates endogenous opioids. Thermal and heat pain thresholds remain unchanged. rTMS induces top-down opioid-mediated inhibition but not change the sensory discrimination of painful stimuli.},

abstract = {Background: Tramadol is an analgesic with monoamine reuptake inhibition and $\mu$-opioid receptor activation. Although tramadol has been widely used for treatment of various pain conditions, there is controversy over the risk of abuse potential. We examined the effects of tramadol on the reward system in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the potential of tramadol for drug abuse or dependence. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted for 19 healthy adults under tramadol or placebo. In association with subjective mood questionnaires, monetary incentive delay (MID) task was performed to assess the neural response to reward anticipation during fMRI. Subjective mood measures and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during gain and loss anticipation were compared between tramadol and placebo. Results: Tramadol significantly reduced anxiety (Z = − 2.513, p = 0.012) and enhanced vigor (Z = − 2.725, p = 0.006) compared with placebo. By Mood Rating Scale, tramadol provoked contented (Z = − 2.316, p = 0.021), relaxed (Z = − 2.236, p = 0.025), and amicable feelings (Z = − 2.015, p = 0.044) as well as increased alertness (Z = − 1.972, p = 0.049) and contentedness domains (Z = − 2.174, p = 0.030) compared with placebo. Several brain regions including nucleus accumbens (NAc) were activated during gain anticipation in the MID task under both tramadol and placebo. Tramadol increased the %BOLD signal change in NAc at +¥500 cue significantly more than the placebo (Z = − 2.295, p = 0.022). Conclusion: Tramadol enhances the reward system and thereby may have abuse potential or precipitate drug abuse in human.},

abstract = {Food intake is mediated, in part, through brain pathways for motivation and reinforcement. Dysregulation of these pathways may underlay some of the behaviors exhibited by patients with eating disorders. Research using animal models of eating disorders has greatly contributed to the detailed study of potential brain mechanisms that many underlie the causes or consequences of aberrant eating behaviors. This review focuses on neurochemical evidence of reward-related brain dysfunctions obtained through animal models of binge eating, bulimia nervosa, or anorexia nervosa. The findings suggest that alterations in dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh) and opioid systems in reward-related brain areas occur in response to binge eating of palatable foods. Moreover, animal models of bulimia nervosa suggest that while bingeing on palatable food releases DA, purging attenuates the release of ACh that might otherwise signal satiety. Animal models of anorexia nervosa suggest that restricted access to food enhances the reinforcing effects of DA when the animal does eat. The activity-based anorexia model suggests alterations in mesolimbic DA and serotonin occur as a result of restricted eating coupled with excessive wheel running. These findings with animal models complement data obtained through neuroimaging and pharmacotherapy studies of clinical populations. Information on the neurochemical consequences of the behaviors associated with these eating disorders will be useful in understanding these complex disorders and may inform future therapeutic approaches, as discussed here.

abstract = {The deleterious outcomes associated with exposure to childhood maltreatment (CM) are well known and may be at least partially mediated by self-harm behaviors. It has been suggested that these self-harm behaviors serve as a means of decreasing negative mood states but the effects of CM on health outcomes may be much more sinister. A wealth of data suggest that CM may lead to experience-dependent changes in neural circuits underlying reward processes; processes associated with many harmful behaviors. The present study examined the relationship between a history of CM and the microstructure of a white matter tract that may be central to reward processes. Healthy adults (N = 122) were assessed with a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) exam and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Probabilistic tractography was used to delineate the accumbofrontal “reward” tract, connecting the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, and measures of white matter microstructure were extracted. We then examined whether variation in CTQ scores were associated with variation in the microstructure of this tract as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA). After accounting for the effects of age and sex, the CTQ total score accounted for approximately 6% of the variance of FA in the accumbofrontal tract (F(3, 121) = 5.74; p = .001). Post hoc analyses indicated that the overall severity of CM, rather than a specific type of maltreatment, drove this result. These findings indicate that CM influences white matter microstructure in a fiber tract that is likely central to reward processes and adds to a growing literature implicating CM in long-term health-related outcomes.},

abstract = {Pathological gambling is a psychiatric disorder and the first recognized behavioral addiction, with similarities to substance use disorders but without the confounding effects of drug-related brain changes. Pathophysiology within the opioid receptor system is increasingly recognized in substance dependence, with higher mu-opioid receptor (MOR) availability reported in alcohol, cocaine and opiate addiction. Impulsivity, a risk factor across the addictions, has also been found to be associated with higher MOR availability. The aim of this study was to characterize baseline MOR availability and endogenous opioid release in pathological gamblers (PG) using [11 C]carfentanil PET with an oral amphetamine challenge. Fourteen PG and 15 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent two [11 C]carfentanil PET scans, before and after an oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg of d-amphetamine. The change in [11 C]carfentanil binding between baseline and post-amphetamine scans ($\Delta$BPND) was assessed in 10 regions of interest (ROI). MOR availability did not differ between PG and HV groups. As seen previously, oral amphetamine challenge led to significant reductions in [11 C]carfentanil BPND in 8/10 ROI in HV. PG demonstrated significant blunting of opioid release compared with HV. PG also showed blunted amphetamine-induced euphoria and alertness compared with HV. Exploratory analysis revealed that impulsivity positively correlated with caudate baseline BPND in PG only. This study provides the first evidence of blunted endogenous opioid release in PG. Our findings are consistent with growing evidence that dysregulation of endogenous opioids may have an important role in the pathophysiology of addictions.},

The ventral tegmental area is the site of non-striatal dopaminergic neurons and their axons project to the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. Injections of spiroperidol, a dopamine antagonist, into the nucleus accumbens significantly reduced self-stimulation of the ipsilateral ventral tegmental area but did not influence self-stimulation of the contralateral ventral tegmental area. Injections of spiroperidol into the prefrontal cortex did not reduce self-stimulation of the ipsilateral or contralateral ventral tegmental area. Electrical stimulation of sites in the nucleus accumbens positive for self-stimulation antidromically activated neurons of the ventral tegmental area, and a reduction of discharge of these neurons following administration of apomorphine suggested that they were dopaminergic neurons.

abstract = {Making predictions about the rewards associated with environmental stimuli and updating those predictions through feedback is an essential aspect of adaptive behavior. Theorists have argued that dopamine encodes a reward prediction error (RPE) signal that is used in such a reinforcement learning process. Recent work with fMRI has demonstrated that the BOLD signal in dopaminergic target areas meets both necessary and sufficient conditions of an axiomatic model of the RPE hypothesis. However, there has been no direct evidence that dopamine release itself also meets necessary and sufficient criteria for encoding an RPE signal. Further, the fact that dopamine neurons have low tonic firing rates that yield a limited dynamic range for encoding negative RPEs has led to significant debate about whether positive and negative prediction errors are encoded on a similar scale. To address both of these issues, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure reward-evoked dopamine release at carbon fiber electrodes chronically implanted in the nucleus accumbens core of rats trained on a probabilistic decision-making task. We demonstrate that dopamine concentrations transmit a bidirectional RPE signal with symmetrical encoding of positive and negative RPEs. Our findings strengthen the case that changes in dopamine concentration alone are sufficient to encode the full range of RPEs necessary for reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Survival is dictated by an organism's fitness in approaching positive stimuli and avoiding harm. While a rich literature outlines a role for mesolimbic dopamine in reward and appetitive behaviors, dopamine's involvement in aversion and avoidance behaviors remains controversial. Debate surrounding dopamine's function in the processing of negative stimuli likely stems from conflicting results reported by single-unit electrophysiological studies. Indeed, a number of studies suggest that midbrain dopaminergic cells are inhibited by the presentation of negative or fearful stimuli, while others report no change, or even an increase, in their activity. These disparate results may be due to population heterogeneity. Recent evidence demonstrates that midbrain dopamine neurons are heterogeneous in their projection targets, responses to environmental stimuli, pharmacology, and influences on motivated behavior. Thus, in order to assemble an accurate account of dopamine function during aversive stimulus experience and related behavior, it is necessary to examine the functional output of dopamine neural activity at mesolimbic terminal regions. This Review presents a growing body of evidence that dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens encodes not only reward, but also aversion. For example, our laboratory recently utilized fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to show that real-time changes in accumbal dopamine release are detected when animals are presented with predictors of aversion and its avoidance. These data, along with other reports, support a considerably more nuanced view of dopamine neuron function, wherein accumbal dopamine release is differentially modulated by positive and negative affective stimuli to promote adaptive behaviors.},

abstract = {Author Summary Dopamine has long been implicated in reward-motivated behaviour. Theory and experiments suggest that activity of dopamine-containing neurons resembles a temporally-sophisticated prediction error used to learn expectations of future reward. This account would appear to be inconsistent with recent observations of ‘ramps', i.e., gradual increases in extracellular dopamine concentration prior to the execution of actions or the acquisition of rewards. We explore three different possible explanations of such ramping signals as arising: (a) when subjects experience uncertainty about when actions will be executed; (b) when dopamine itself influences the timecourse of choice; and (c) under a new model in which ‘quasi-tonic' dopamine signals arise through a form of temporal discounting. We thereby show that dopamine ramps can be integrated with current theories, and also suggest experiments to clarify which mechanisms are involved.},

abstract = {Abstract Reacting appropriately to errors during task performance is fundamental to successful negotiation of our environment. This is especially true when errors will result in a significant penalty for the person performing a given task, be they financial or otherwise. Error responses and monitoring states were manipulated in a GO/NOGO task by introducing a financial punishment for errors. This study employed a mixed block design alternating between punishment and no punishment (neutral) conditions, enabling an assessment of tonic changes associated with cognitive control as well as trial-specific effects. Behavioural results revealed slower responses and fewer commission errors in the punishment condition. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) had equal trial-specific activity for errors in the neutral and punishment conditions but had greater tonic activity throughout the punishment condition. A region of interest analysis revealed different activation patterns between the dorsal and the rostral parts of the ACC with the rostral ACC having only trial-specific activity for errors in the punishment condition, an activity profile similar to one observed in the nucleus accumbens. This study suggests that there is a motivational influence on cognitive processes in the ACC and nucleus accumbens and hints at a dissociation between tonic proactive activity and phasic reactive error-related activity.

abstract = {Abstract Learning efficacy depends on its emotional context. The contents learned and the feedback received during training tinges this context. The objective here was to investigate the influence of content and feedback on the efficacy of implicit learning and to explore using functional imaging how these factors are processed in the brain. Twenty-one participants completed 150 trials of a probabilistic classification task (predicting sun or rain based on combinations of playing cards). Smileys or frowneys were presented as feedback. In 10 of these subjects, the task was performed during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Card combinations predicting sun were remembered better than those predicting rain. Similarly, positive feedback fortified learning more than negative feedback. The presentation of smileys recruited bilateral nucleus accumbens, sensorimotor cortex, and posterior cingulum more than negative feedback did. The higher the predictive value of a card combination, the more activation was found in the lateral cerebellum. Both context and feedback influence implicit classification learning. Similar to motor skill acquisition, positive feedback during classification learning is processed in part within the sensorimotor cortex, potentially reflecting the activation of a dopaminergic projection to motor cortex (Hosp et al., 2011). Activation of the lateral cerebellum during learning of combinations with high predictive value may reflect the formation of an internal model. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Although the nucleus accumbens has been implicated in the underlying neural substrate, its criticality to human behaviour remains an open question, best addressed with interventional methodology that probes the behavioural consequences of focal neural modulation. Combining a psychometric index of risky decision-making with transient electrical modulation of the nucleus accumbens, here we reveal profound, highly dynamic alteration of the relation between probability of reward and choice during therapeutic deep brain stimulation in four patients with treatment-resistant psychiatric disease. Short-lived phasic electrical stimulation of the region of the nucleus accumbens dynamically altered risk behaviour, transiently shifting the psychometric function towards more risky decisions only for the duration of stimulation. A critical, on-line role of human nucleus accumbens in dynamic risk control is thereby established.},

abstract = {Research in animals suggests that decisions about physical versus cognitive effort have distinct neural bases, but exploration of this question in humans is hampered by lack of parallel measures of physical and cognitive effort for rewards. We developed a novel measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort for rewards, the C-EEfRT, paralleling the validated physical effort expenditure for rewards task (EEfRT). To validate the C-EEfRT we: (a) tested whether EEfRT and C-EEfRT tasks were equivalently difficult; (b) tested whether decisions on the EEfRT and C-EEfRT were equivalently responsive to changes in reward; (c) examined relationships between the C-EEfRT and anhedonia, intelligence, and working memory. Last, we tested the relationship between willingness to exert physical and cognitive effort for rewards in humans. Sixty healthy adults completed the EEfRT, the C-EEfRT, an anhedonia self-report, an intelligence test, and a working memory task. Overall willingness to exert effort was higher on the C-EEfRT than the EEfRT, particularly when reward probability and amount were low. This was despite participants perceiving the cognitive task as more difficult, and having greater difficulty completing it. Differential effects of physical fatigue may have contributed. Anhedonia was not related to effort on either measure. Working memory, but not intelligence, was associated with cognitive effort. There was a moderate relationship between cognitive and physical effort. These findings suggest the importance of measuring cognitive effort as distinct from physical effort in humans. Future studies should consider calibrating task difficulty for each individual, and exploring cognitive effort in clinical populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

A systematic review of literature investigating the association between FA and fMRI BOLD response was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The PubMed and Web of Knowledge databases were searched up until 22.04.2016 using a predetermined set of search criteria. The search identified 363 papers, 28 of which met the specified inclusion criteria. Positive relationships were mainly observed in studies investigating the primary sensory and motor systems and in resting state data. Both positive and negative relationships were seen in studies using cognitive tasks. This systematic review suggests that there is a relationship between FA and the fMRI BOLD response and that the relationship is task and region dependent. Behavioural and/or clinical variables were shown to be essential in interpreting the relationships between imaging measures. The results highlight the heterogeneity in the methods used across papers in terms of fMRI task, population investigated and data analysis techniques.

Despite the prevalence of this research, it is still unclear which psychological mechanism underlies the immediate reaction to cues of ostracism. According to the social-physical pain overlap theory, cues to ostracism induce a social pain response akin to physical pain due to shared neurological substrates between social and physical pain. Alternatively, it is possible that the immediate reaction to ostracism reflects a conflict detection mechanism responding to a violation of the expectation that one should be socially included. In the present studies, we used pupillometry to distinguish the immediate reaction to ostracism in terms of it primarily representing a pain-oriented response or a conflict-detection response. We continuously measured the pupillary reaction during games of Cyberball, which contained social inclusion events (a ball thrown to the participant) and exclusion events (a ball thrown to another player). We find that participants show a diminished pupillary reaction to cues of exclusion but not to cues of inclusion, consistent with the social-physical pain overlap theory.},

It offers a treatment approach for alcohol-dependent individuals with “high-risk drinking levels” to reduce their alcohol consumption. However, the neurobiological mechanism underpinning its effects on alcohol consumption remains to be determined. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design we aimed to determine the effect of a single dose of nalmefene on striatal blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signal change during anticipation of monetary reward using the monetary incentive delay task following alcohol challenge. Methods Twenty-two currently heavy-drinking, non–treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent males were recruited. The effect of single dose nalmefene (18 mg) on changes in a priori defined striatal region of interest BOLD signal change during reward anticipation compared with placebo was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Both conditions were performed under intravenous alcohol administration (6% vol/vol infusion to achieve a target level of 80 mg/dL). Results Datasets from 18 participants were available and showed that in the presence of the alcohol infusion, nalmefene significantly reduced the BOLD response in the striatal region of interest compared with placebo. Nalmefene did not alter brain perfusion. Conclusions Nalmefene blunts BOLD response in the mesolimbic system during anticipation of monetary reward and an alcohol infusion. This is consistent with nalmefene's actions on opioid receptors, which modulate the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and provides a neurobiological basis for its efficacy.},

The A118G single nucleotide polymorphism in this receptor has been implicated in drug addiction and differences in pain response. Clinical and preclinical studies have found that the G allele is associated with increased heroin reward and self-administration, elevated post-operative pain, and reduced analgesic responsiveness to opioids. Male and female mice homozygous for the “humanized” 118AA or 118GG alleles were evaluated to test the hypothesis that 118GG mice are less sensitive to the rewarding and antinociceptive effects of morphine. We found that 118AA and 118GG mice of both genders developed conditioned place preference for morphine. All mice developed tolerance to the antinociceptive and hypothermic effects of morphine. However, morphine tolerance was not different between AA and GG mice. We also examined sensitivity to the antinociceptive and hypothermic effects of cumulative morphine doses. We found that 118GG mice show reduced hypothermic and antinociceptive responses on the hotplate for 10 mg/kg morphine. Finally, we examined basal pain response and morphine-induced antinociception in the formalin test for inflammatory pain. We found no gender or genotype differences in either basal pain response or morphine-induced antinociception in the formalin test. Our data suggests that homozygous expression of the GG allele in mice blunts morphine-induced hypothermia and hotplate antinociception but does not alter morphine CPP, morphine tolerance, or basal inflammatory pain response.},

Current knowledge fails to define the neurobiological processes underlying social behaviour involving the (patho-) physiological mechanisms that link system-level phenomena to the multiple hierarchies of brain function. Unfortunately, such a high complexity may also be associated with a high susceptibility to several pathogenic interventions. Consistently, social deficits sometimes represent the first signs of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (SCZ), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) which leads to a progressive social dysfunction. In the present review we summarize present knowledge linking neurobiological substrates sustaining social functioning, social dysfunction and social withdrawal in major psychiatric disorders.

abstract = {Close social bonds are critical to a happy and fulfilled life and yet little is known, in humans, about the neurochemical mechanisms that keep individuals feeling close and connected to one another. According to the brain opioid theory of social attachment, opioids may underlie the contented feelings associated with social connection and may be critical to continued bonding. However, the role of opioids in feelings of connection toward close others has only begun to be examined in humans. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of naltrexone (an opioid antagonist), 31 volunteers took naltrexone for 4 days and placebo for 4 days (separated by a 10-day washout period). Participants came to the laboratory once on the last day of taking each drug to complete a task designed to elicit feelings of social connection. Participants also completed daily reports of feelings of social connection while on naltrexone and placebo. In line with hypotheses, and for the first time in humans, results demonstrated that naltrexone (vs placebo) reduced feelings of connection both in the laboratory and in daily reports. These results highlight the importance of opioids for social bonding with close others, lending support to the brain opioid theory of social attachment.},

abstract = {While research on neuroscience posits that intrinsic and extrinsic incentives involve a single, common psychological process based on a reinforcement learning model (forming a “commonality view” on motivation), research in psychology has made a strong distinction between these two types of incentives (forming a “multifaceted view” on motivation), often even viewing them as competitive. Although they are not necessarily contradictory, I argue that these two meta-theoretical views have biased and prevented our comprehensive understanding of motivation and its relation to learning. I suggest ways that these different perspectives can inform each other, contributing to our broader understanding of human motivation and learning. These examples include the effects of reward on learning, the way people can transform one type of motivation to another, and a rewarding view for effort, challenge, and negative feedback. The arguments presented in this chapter underscore the vital importance of cross-disciplinary work on motivation and learning in future studies.},

Methods Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain activation in adult patients with ADHD (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 12) was examined during a series of choices between two monetary reward options that varied by delay to delivery. Results Compared with healthy control subjects, hyporesponsiveness of the ventral-striatal reward system was replicated in patients with ADHD and was evident for both immediate and delayed rewards. In contrast, delayed rewards evoked hyperactivation in dorsal caudate nucleus and amygdala of ADHD patients. In both structures, neural activity toward delayed rewards was significantly correlated with self-rated ADHD symptom severity. Conclusions The finding of ventral-striatal hyporesponsiveness during immediate and delayed reward processing in patients with ADHD further strengthens the concept of a diminished neural processing of rewards in ADHD. Hyperactivation during delayed reward processing, gradually increasing along the ventral-to-dorsal extension of the caudate nucleus, and especially the concomitant hyperactivation of the amygdala are in accordance with predictions of the delay aversion hypothesis.},

abstract = {Patients sustaining lesions of the orbital prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibit marked impairments in the performance of laboratory-based gambling, or risk-taking, tasks, suggesting that this part of the human PFC contributes to decision-making cognition. However, to date, little is known about the particular regions of the orbital cortex that participate in this function. In the present study, eight healthy volunteers were scanned, using H(2)(15)0 PET technology, while performing a novel computerized risk-taking task. The task involved predicting which of two mutually exclusive outcomes would occur, but critically, the larger reward (and penalty) was associated with choice of the least likely outcome, whereas the smallest reward (and penalty) was associated with choice of the most likely outcome. Resolving these "conflicting" decisions was associated with three distinct foci of regional cerebral blood flow increase within the right inferior and orbital PFC: laterally, in the anterior part of the middle frontal gyrus [Brodmann area 10 (BA 10)], medially, in the orbital gyrus (BA 11), and posteriorly, in the anterior portion of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47). By contrast, increases in the degree of conflict inherent in these decisions was associated with only limited changes in activity within orbital PFC and the anterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that decision making recruits neural activity from multiple regions of the inferior PFC that receive information from a diverse set of cortical and limbic inputs, and that the contribution of the orbitofrontal regions may involve processing changes in reward-related information.},

Measurement properties of the DAST were evaluated using a clinical sample of 256 drug/alcohol abuse clients. The internal consistency reliability estimate was substantial at .92, and a factor analysis of item intercorrelations suggested an unidimensional scale. With respect to response style biases, the DAST was only moderately correlated with social desirability and denial. Concurrent validity was examined by correlating the DAST with background variables, frequency of drug use during the past 12 months, and indices of psychopathology. Although these findings support the usefulness of the DAST for quantifying the extent of drug involvement within a help-seeking population, further validation work is needed in other populations and settings.},

abstract = {The opioid system regulates affective processing, including pain, pleasure, and reward. Restricting the role of this system to hedonic modulation may be an underestimation, however. Opioid receptors are distributed widely in the human brain, including the more “cognitive” regions in the frontal and parietal lobes. Nonhuman animal research points to opioid modulation of cognitive and decision-making processes. We review emerging evidence on whether acute opioid drug modulation in healthy humans can influence cognitive function, such as how we choose between actions of different values and how we control our behavior in the face of distracting information. Specifically, we review studies employing opioid agonists or antagonists together with experimental paradigms of reward-based decision making, impulsivity, executive functioning, attention, inhibition, and effort. Although this field is still in its infancy, the emerging picture suggests that the mu-opioid system can influence higher-level cognitive function via modulation of valuation, motivation, and control circuits dense in mu-opioid receptors, including orbitofrontal cortex, basal ganglia, amygdalae, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex. The framework that we put forward proposes that opioids influence decision making and cognitive control by increasing the subjective value of reward and reducing aversive arousal. We highlight potential mechanisms that might underlie the effects of mu-opioid signaling on decision making and cognitive control and provide directions for future research.},

abstract = {Social play behaviour is a vigorous form of social interaction abundant during the juvenile and adolescent phases of life in many mammalian species, including rats and humans. Social play is thought to be important for social, emotional and cognitive development. Being a rewarding activity, the expression of social play depends on its pleasurable and motivational properties. Since opioids have been widely implicated in reward processes, in the present study we investigated the role of opioids in the pleasurable and motivational properties of social play behaviour in rats. To assess social play motivation, an operant conditioning setup was used in which rats responded for social play under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Treatment with the opioid receptor agonist morphine reduced responding for social play at the highest dose tested, likely due to its rate-limiting effects. Morphine treatment increased the expression of social play behaviour during reinforced periods. The acquisition of social play-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in a subeffective conditioning protocol was enhanced by treatment with morphine. Morphine treatment alone also induced CPP. In contrast, antagonizing opioid receptors with naloxone reduced responding for social play, the expression of social play and blocked the development of social play-induced CPP. These data implicate opioid neurotransmission in both the pleasurable and the motivational aspects of social play behaviour in rats.

abstract = {Positive social interactions are essential for emotional well-being and proper behavioral development of young individuals. Here, we studied the neural underpinnings of social reward by investigating the involvement of opioid neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in social play behavior, a highly rewarding social interaction in adolescent rats. Intra-NAc infusion of morphine (0.05- 0.1 $\mu$) increased pinning and pouncing, characteristic elements of social play behavior in rats, and blockade of NAc opioid receptors with naloxone (0.5 $\mu$) prevented the play-enhancing effects of systemic morphine (1 mg/kg, s.c.) administration. Thus, stimulation of opioid receptors in the NAc was necessary and sufficient for morphine to increase social play. Intra-NAc treatment with the selective &mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) (0.1-10 ng) and the $\Delta$-opioid receptor antagonist Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTAP) (0.3-3 $\mu$) increased and decreased social play, respectively. The S-opioid receptor agonist DPDPE ([D-Pen2,D-Pen5]-enkephalin) (0.3-3 $\mu$) had no effects, whereas the K-opioid receptor agonist U69593 (N-methyl-2-phenyl-N-[(5R,7S,8S)-7-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl]acetamide) (0.01-1 $\mu$g) decreased social play. Intra-NAc treatment with $\beta$-endorphin (0.01-1 $\mu$g) increased social play, but met-enkephalin (0.1-5 $\mu$g) and the en-kephalinase inhibitor thiorphan (0.1-1 $\mu$) were ineffective. DAMGO (0.1-10 ng) increased social play after infusion into both the shell and core subregions oftheNAc. Last, intra-NAc infusion of CTAP (3 $\mu$g) prevented the development of social play-induced conditioned place preference. These findings identify NAc $\mu$-opioid receptor stimulation as an important neural mechanism for the attribution of positive value to social interactions in adolescent rats. Altered NAc $\mu$-opioid receptor function may underlie social impairments in psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, or personality disorders {\textcopyright}2011 the authors.},

It has been proposed that endogenous opioid release after social laughter would provide a neurochemical pathway supporting long-term relationships in humans (Dunbar, 2012), yet this hypothesis currently lacks direct neurophysiological support. We used PET and the $\mu$-opioid-receptor (MOR)-specific ligand [11C]carfentanil to quantify laughter-induced endogenous opioid release in 12 healthy males. Before the social laughter scan, the subjects watched laughter-inducing comedy clips with their close friends for 30 min. Before the baseline scan, subjects spent 30 min alone in the testing room. Social laughter increased pleasurable sensations and triggered endogenous opioid release in thalamus, caudate nucleus, and anterior insula. In addition, baseline MOR availability in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices was associated with the rate of social laughter. In a behavioral control experiment, pain threshold—a proxy of endogenous opioidergic activation—was elevated significantly more in both male and female volunteers after watching laughter-inducing comedy versus non-laughter-inducing drama in groups. Modulation of the opioidergic activity by social laughter may be an important neurochemical pathway that supports the formation, reinforcement, and maintenance of human social bonds.},

Research now shows that social pain results from the activation of certain components in physical pain systems. Although social, clinical, health, and developmental psychologists have each explored aspects of social pain, recent work from the neurosciences provides a coherent, unifying framework for integrative research. This edited volume provides the first comprehensive, multidisciplinary exploration of social pain. Part I examines the subject from a neuroscience perspective, outlining the evolutionary basis of social pain and tracing the genetic, neurological, and physiological underpinnings of the phenomenon. Part II explores the implications of social pain for functioning in interpersonal relationships; contributions examine the influence of painkillers on social emotions, the ability to relive past social hurts, and the relation of social pain to experiences of intimacy. Part III examines social pain from a biopsychosocial perspective in its consideration of the health implications of social pain, outlining the role of stress in social pain and the potential long-term health consequences of bullying. The book concludes with an integrative review of these diverse perspectives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {The paper on, ?missing brides in rural Haryana: A study of adverse sex ratio, poverty and addiction ? highlights that the phenomena of across-region marriages is not new. Such marriages have always taken place especially in Punjab, Haryana and other adjoining states. For example, Jatsfrom Haryana would marry Jatsfrom neighbouring UP and Rajasthan or a person from Punjab will look for a bride from the border of Haryana like Kaithal, Narwana. But what is significant is the fact that now a Jat or Chauhanfrom Haryana is marrying a women of intermediate or low caste from Assam, Bengal, or Bihar. Not only this the frequency of such marriages has also increased and these marriages not only speak of spatial distance but also socio-cultural heterogeneity. This study examines the socio-cultural and economic dimensions of such marriages and raises some pertinent questions regarding the acceptance of such marriages in rural Haryana. How a society which otherwise places so much value on caste, gotra and village exogamy is willing to accept marriages in which women are brought from across the cultural, regional and language context, where caste and sometimes even religion is different. How do such women adjust to a culturally different environment which is rigid and patriarchal than their own? The survey was conducted in three villages of Rohtak and Jind districts of Haryana. The study suggests that these unusual marriages are a consequence of combination of factors like low sex-ratio, poverty, and unemployment.},

abstract = {Addictions are commonly accompanied by a sense of shame or self-stigmatization. Self-stigmatization results from public stigmatization in a process leading to the internalization of the social opprobrium attaching to the negative stereotypes associated with addiction. We offer an account of how this process works in terms of a range of looping effects, and this leads to our main claim that for a significant range of cases public stigma figures in the social construction of addiction. This rests on a social constructivist account in which those affected by public stigmatization internalize its norms. Stigma figures as part-constituent of the dynamic process in which addiction is formed. Our thesis is partly theoretical, partly empirical, as we source our claims about the process of internalization from interviews with people in treatment for substance use problems.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews research on the association of alcohol and self-regulation and reaches several conclusions. First, although individuals low in self-control are more likely to drink to excess, individuals often consume alcohol in a specific attempt to exert control over their affective and cognitive experiences. Second, although these effects are to some extent driven by the pharmacological effect of alcohol, expectancies regarding the effects of the drug also influence various aspects of alcohol consumption. Third, given that alcohol consumption is influenced by expectancies, it is important to understand the variables that shape these expectancies. Fourth, although alcohol would appear to have generally deleterious effects on self-regulation, these effects are neither simple nor straightforward. Fifth, despite the fact that various candidates have been offered as attentional, cognitive, and affective mediators of the impact of alcohol on self-regulation, definitive support for any one psychological mechanism is lacking. Ultimately, although progress has been made in understanding how alcohol affects self-regulation, additional research is necessary to illuminate precisely why it has these effects as well as the conditions necessary to overcome these effects.

abstract = {The $\mu$ opioid receptor (MOR) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is involved in assigning pleasurable, or hedonic value to rewarding stimuli. Importantly, the hedonic value of a given rewarding stimulus likely depends on an individual's current motivational state. Here, we examined the involvement of MORs in the motivation to interact with a novel or a familiar (cage mate) conspecific in juvenile rats. First, we demonstrated that the selective MOR antagonist CTAP administered into the NAc reduces social novelty preference of juvenile males, by decreasing the interaction time with the novel conspecific and increasing the interaction time with the cage mate. Next, we found that a 3-h separation period from the cage mate reduces social novelty preference in both juvenile males and females, which was primarily driven by an increase in interaction time with the cage mate. Last, we showed that MOR agonism (intracerebroventricularly or in the NAc) restored social novelty preference in juvenile males that did not show social novelty preference following social isolation. Taken together, these data support a model in which endogenous MOR activation in the NAc facilitates the relative hedonic value of novel over familiar social stimuli. Our results may implicate the MOR in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by altered social motivation, such as major depression and autism spectrum disorder.},

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed a one-factor structure of IGD criteria. The IGD scale showed satisfactory validity and reliability and was related in a consistent way with well-being measures. The IGD scale appears to be an appropriate measure to assess video game addiction and will contribute to increase the comparability of international research on video game addiction.},

He has been a pioneer in cognitive science and is one of the founders of the field of cognitive neuroscience. The experimental paradigms he has developed have provided a major foundation for the imaging of the human brain. It is our great honor and pleasure to work with him as he continues his pioneering efforts, now focusing on attentional development and its relation to education. Our development of marker tasks based on patterns of adult brain activation has allowed us to study infant and child development in neuroscientifically informed, yet nonintrusive ways. Together with Posner, we have been studying temperament in infants and young children in relation to underlying neural networks for self-control. Our effort began with the study of temperament and proceeded to making links between temperamental dimensions and neural circuitry using marker tasks derived from adult imaging studies. The levels of analysis available for this exploration now range from molecular genetics to the socialization of behavior. We hope that by furthering methodological links between different levels of analysis, a basis will be provided for examining the many exciting questions at their interface. This chapter examines parallel developments of executive attention and self-regulation, as well as the genetic and experience-related factors that influence the functioning of this system.

abstract = {Addicts and alcoholics suffer vulnerabilities and deficits in self-regulation. A principal manifestation of their self-regulation disturbances is evident in the way they attempt to self-medicate painful affect states and related psychiatric problems. Individuals select a particular drug based on its ability to relieve or augment emotions unique to an individual which they cannot achieve or maintain on their own. Addicts and alcoholics usually experiment with all classes of drugs, but discover that a particular drug suits them best. Usually, painful affect states interact with other problems in self-regulation involving self-esteem, relationships, self-care, and related characterological defenses, making it more likely that addicts will experiment with and find the action of a particular drug appealing or compelling. Stimulants have their appeal because their energizing properties relieve distress associated with depression, hypomania, and hyperactivity; opiates are compelling because they mute and contain disorganizing affects of rage and aggression; and sedative hypnotics, including alcohol, permit the experience of affection, aggression, and closeness in individuals who are otherwise cut off from their feelings and relationships.},

With 4-year panel data from young adolescents (N = 968, 50.7% girls; M age = 13.3 years) in South Korea, this study examined the effects of cultural environmental factors (parents' excessive interference, communication with parents, and friends' and teachers' support) on pathological gaming through academic stress and self-control. The results showed the critical role of academic stress and self-control in the effects of environmental factors on pathological gaming. Parents' excessive interference increased the degree to which youth experienced academic stress while the degree of communication with parents decreased this stress. Increased academic stress damaged self-control, which finally increased the degree of pathological gaming. Self-control affected the degree of pathological gaming stronger than gaming time did. The theoretical and practical implications from the study findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Individual differences in pain sensitivity and reactivity are well recognized but the underlying mechanisms are likely to be diverse. The phenomenon of stress-induced analgesia is well documented in animal research and individual variability in the stress response in humans may produce corresponding changes in pain. We assessed the magnitude of the acute stress response of 16 chronic back pain (CBP) patients and 18 healthy individuals exposed to noxious thermal stimulations administered in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment and tested its possible contribution to individual differences in pain perception. The temperature of the noxious stimulations was determined individually to control for differences in pain sensitivity. The two groups showed similar significant increases in reactive cortisol across the scanning session when compared with their basal levels collected over 7 consecutive days, suggesting normal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis reactivity to painful stressors in CBP patients. Critically, after controlling for any effect of group and stimulus temperature, individuals with stronger cortisol responses reported less pain unpleasantness and showed reduced blood oxygenation level-dependent activation in nucleus accumbens at the stimulus onset and in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC), the primary somatosensory cortex, and the posterior insula. Mediation analyses indicated that pain-related activity in the aMCC mediated the relationship between the reactive cortisol response and the pain unpleasantness. Psychophysiological interaction analysis further revealed that higher stress reactivity was associated with reduced functional connectivity between the aMCC and the brainstem. These findings suggest that acute stress modulates pain in humans and contributes to individual variability in pain affect and pain-related brain activity.},

Reward refers to the fact that certain environmental stimuli have the property of eliciting approach responses. Evidence suggests that the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens area) is central to the mediation of this behavior. Reinforcement refers to the tendency of certain stimuli to strengthen learned stimulus-response tendencies. The dorsolateral striatum appears to be central to the mediation of this behavior. Neuroanatomical and neurochemical data are adduced suggesting that reward may be mediated by a neural circuit including the neostriatal patch system, together with the hippocampus, limbic system (amygdala, prefrontal cortex) and ventral pallidum. The evidence also suggests that reinforcement, in the form of dopamine release in the striatal matrix, acts to promote the consolidation of sensori-motor associations. Thus, the matrix may mediate stimulus-response memory as part of a circuit including the cerebral cortex, substantia nigra pars reticulata and its projections to thalamic and brainstem motor areas.},

abstract = {Background: Rodent models highlight the key role of $\mu$-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling in palatable food consumption. In humans, however, the effects of MOR stimulation on eating and food liking remain unclear. Objectives: Here, we tested sweet pleasantness experience in humans following MOR drug manipulations. We hypothesized that behaviors regulated by the endogenous MOR system would be enhanced by MOR agonism and decreased by antagonism. In line with rodent findings, we expected the strongest drug effects for the sweetest (high-calorie) sucrose stimuli. As very sweet stimuli are considered aversive by many people (called sweet dislikers), we also assessed whether MOR manipulations affect pleasantness ratings of sucrose-water stimuli differently depending on subjective and objective value. Methods: In a bidirectional psychopharmacological cross-over study, 49 healthy men underwent a sweet taste paradigm following double-blind administration of the MOR agonist morphine, placebo, and the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Results: As hypothesized, MOR stimulation with morphine increased pleasantness of the sweetest of five sucrose solutions, without enhancing pleasantness of the lower-sucrose solutions. For opioid antagonism, an opposite pattern was observed for the sweetest drink only. The observed drug effects on pleasantness of the sweetest drink did not differ between sweet likers and dislikers. Conclusions: The bidirectional effect of agonist and antagonist treatment aligns with rodent findings showing that MOR manipulations most strongly affect the highest-calorie foods. We speculate that the MOR system promotes survival in part by increasing concordance between the objective (caloric) and subjective (hedonic) value of food stimuli, so that feeding behavior becomes more focused on the richest food available.},

abstract = {Since its first description four decades ago, attachment theory (AT) has become one of the principal developmental psychological frameworks for describing the role of individual differences in the establishment and maintenance of social bonds between people. Yet, still little is known about the neurobiological underpinnings of attachment orientations and their well-established impact on a range of social and affective behaviors. In the present review, we summarize data from recent studies using cognitive and imaging approaches to characterize attachment styles and their effect on emotion and social cognition. We propose a functional neuroanatomical framework to integrate the key brain mechanisms involved in the perception and regulation of social emotional information, and their modulation by individual differences in terms of secure versus insecure (more specifically avoidant, anxious, or resolved versus unresolved) attachment traits. This framework describes how each individual's attachment style (built through interactions between personal relationship history and predispositions) may influence the encoding of approach versus aversion tendencies (safety versus threat) in social encounters, implicating the activation of a network of subcortical (amygdala, hippocampus, striatum) and cortical (insula, cingulate) limbic areas. These basic and automatic affective evaluation mechanisms are in turn modulated by more elaborate and voluntary cognitive control processes, subserving mental state attribution and emotion regulation capacities, implicating a distinct network in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), among others. Recent neuroimaging data suggest that affective evaluation is decreased in avoidantly but increased in anxiously attached individuals. In turn, although data on cognitive control is still scarce, it points toward a possible enhancement of mental state representations associated with attachment insecurity and particularly anxiety. Emotion regulation strategies such as reappraisal or suppression of social emotions are also differentially modulated by attachment style. This research does not only help better understand the neural underpinnings of human social behavior, but also provides important insights on psychopathological conditions where attachment dysregulation is likely to play an important (causal) role. {\textcopyright} 2012 Vrti{\v{c}}ka and Vuilleumier.},

abstract = {Attachment theory describes how people emotionally bond with others, utilize their social interactions to regulate affective needs, and how they differ in their attachment style. However, it remains unknown whether anxious or avoidant attachment is linked to more general differences in emotional processing for negative and positive stimuli, and whether such differences depend on stimulus content. Here we tested how social or non-social positive or negative emotional scenes were rated for pleasantness, arousal, and control, as a function of individual attachment style, in a sample of 54 female participants. Our results show that avoidant attachment was associated with a selective reduction of pleasantness ratings for positive social images, whereas anxious attachment was associated with higher arousal and lower control ratings for negative social images, besides higher arousal ratings for all remaining stimulus categories. These findings reveal that adult attachment style is associated with differences in the perception of emotion-laden stimuli, even when unfamiliar and not directly attachment-related, and such differences may also affect positive scenes, particularly when they contain social information, rather than just socially negative or threatening information. In addition, our results support the notion that anxious attachment is not only associated with hyperactivating tendency during the appraisal of social threat, but may also involve an ambivalence influencing the judgments of both positive and negative information. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

In this opinion article, novel actions of $\mu$-opioid peptides in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that could contribute to inhibitory control deficits will be discussed. Evidence has accrued to suggest that excessive intra-PFC $\mu$-opioid receptor ($\mu$-OR) signaling alters the PFC response to excitatory drive, resulting in supernormal and incoherent recruitment of multiple PFC output pathways. Affected pathways include functionally opposed PFC→hypothalamus 'appetitive driver' and PFC→striatum 'appetitive limiter' projections. This network perturbation engenders disorganized, impulsive appetitive responses. Evidence supporting this hypothesis from human imaging and animal studies will be discussed, and combinatorial drug treatments targeting $\mu$-ORs and specific PFC subcortical targets will be explored.},

abstract = {? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Human attachment behavior mediates establishment and maintenance of social relationships. Adult attachment characteristically varies on anxiety and avoidance dimensions, reflecting the tendencies to worry about the partner breaking the social bond (anxiety) and feeling uncomfortable about depending on others (avoidance). In primates and other mammals, the endogenous ?-opioid system is linked to long-term social bonding, but evidence of its role in human adult attachment remains more limited. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to reveal how variability in ?-opioid receptor (MOR) availability is associated with adult attachment in humans. We scanned 49 healthy subjects using a MOR-specific ligand [11C]carfentanil and measured their attachment avoidance and anxiety with the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised scale. The avoidance dimension of attachment correlated negatively with MOR availability in the thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the frontal cortex, amygdala, and insula. No associations were observed between MOR availability and the anxiety dimension of attachment. Our results suggest that the endogenous opioid system may underlie interindividual differences in avoidant attachment style in human adults, and that differences in MOR availability are associated with the individuals' social relationships and psychosocial well-being.},

abstract = {Inter-individual touch can be a desirable reward that can both relieve negative affect and evoke strong feelings of pleasure. However, if other sensory cues indicate it is undesirable to interact with the toucher, the affective experience of the same touch may be flipped to disgust. While a broad literature has addressed, on one hand the neurophysiological basis of ascending touch pathways, and on the other hand the central neurochemistry involved in touch behaviors, investigations of how external context and internal state shapes the hedonic value of touch have only recently emerged. Here, we review the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms responsible for the integration of tactile “bottom-up” stimuli and “top-down” information into affective touch experiences. We highlight the reciprocal influences between gentle touch and contextual information, and consider how, and at which levels of neural processing, top-down influences may modulate ascending touch signals. Finally, we discuss the central neurochemistry, specifically the µ-opioids and oxytocin systems, involved in affective touch processing, and how the functions of these neurotransmitters largely depend on the context and motivational state of the individual.},

abstract = {Recent evidence from neurophysiology and human functional neuroimaging has given rise to the hypothesis that social, affective touch belongs to a distinct category of tactile experience. Such hedonic and rewarding touch is proposed to operate mainly in the domain of social interactions and relationships. Social touch may play a functional role in the physiological regulation of the body's responses to acute stressors and other short-term challenges. In this perspective, touch can Bbuffer^ disadvantageous physio- logical effects of potentially inefficient or maladaptive responses. This review outlines the evidence for such a role, as well as the neural pathways that may support it. Direct evidence for touch as a physiological regulator is strongest for systems that underlie the maintenance of physical proximity to conspecifics in a variety of circumstances. For example, mammalian social physical contact involves social thermoregulatory process- es like huddling and snuggling, which also rely on tactile thermosensory and somato- sensory pathways. There is also good evidence that touch systems contribute to preventing social separation and facilitating the re-instatement of contact following social separation. Finally, prosocial touch, such as allogrooming and consolation, may utilize some of the same neural pathways as other, non-socialmeans of stress regulation. Social touch may thus serve as part of a system for regulation of responses to acute stressors, Bextended^ to include the physiological effects of social interactions.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that prior cannabis exposure increases the likelihood of becoming addicted to other drugs can be evaluated by giving rats a history of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure, then allowing them to self-administer other drugs. In Experiment 1, THC pre-exposure did not alter the acquisition of cocaine self-administration or the amount of cocaine taken under a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule, with one response required for each injection. Under a progressive-ratio schedule, with the response requirement increasing exponentially with each injection, cocaine-seeking was significantly reduced in THC-exposed rats, suggesting that the regimen of THC exposure used in the present study caused cocaine to be devalued as a reinforcer. In contrast, in an earlier study that used the same regimen, a history of THC exposure did not alter the value of heroin as a reinforcer under the progressive-ratio schedule, but it increased heroin self-administration under the FR1 schedule. Experiment 2 examined how this regimen of THC pre-exposure alters the locomotor effects of cocaine and heroin. THC pre-exposure produced cross-tolerance to the motor-depressant effects of heroin; this may explain the shortened post-injection pauses exhibited by THC-exposed rats under FR1 heroin self-administration. When given cocaine, THC-exposed rats exhibited normal increases in locomotion, but they avoided the center of the open field, suggesting that this THC pre-exposure regimen enhances the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. This enhanced anxiogenic effect-which was verified in Experiment 3 using another model of anxiety, the light-dark test-may explain the reduced reinforcing value of cocaine observed in THC-exposed rats in Experiment 1.},

abstract = {In rats trained to self-administer heroin or cocaine intravenously, non-contingent priming injections of heroin or cocaine, respectively, reinstated responding after a period of extinction. In rats similarly trained to self-administer heroin or cocaine intravenously, morphine sulphate was applied centrally to sites in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the periventricular grey (PVG) and the caudate nucleus following a period of extinction. Self-administration behavior was reinstated by morphine application to sites in the region of the VTA, but not to other sites, in both heroin and cocaine-trained animals. This priming effect of morphine was blocked or attenuated by prior administration of naltrexone, given intraperitoneally. Morphine in the VTA is known to activate mesolimbic dopamine neurons, suggesting that dopamine activity in this system may underline the priming effects of both opiates and stimulants. Furthermore, the fact that the mesolimbic system is implicated in the positive motivational actions of both drug groups, suggests that morphine reinstates drug-taking behavior in these animals by activating appetitive motivational systems of the brain. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

Previous research has shown that during direct (Pavlovian) threat learning, information about personally experienced outcomes is regulated by the release of endogenous opioids, and activity within the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Here we report that blockade of this opioidergic circuit enhances social threat learning through observation in humans involving activity within the amygdala, midline thalamus and the PAG. In particular, anticipatory responses to learned threat cues (CS) were associated with temporal dynamics in the PAG, coding the observed aversive outcomes to other (observational US). In addition, pharmacological challenge of the opioid receptor function is classified by distinct brain activity patterns during the expression of conditioned threats. Our results reveal an opioidergic circuit that codes the observed aversive outcomes to others into threat responses and long-term memory in the observer.},

abstract = {Personal social network size exhibits considerable variation in the human population and is associated with both physical and mental health status. Much of this inter-individual variation in human sociality remains unexplained from a biological perspective. According to the brain opioid theory of social attachment, binding of the neuropeptide $\beta$-endorphin to $\mu$-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) is a key neurochemical mechanism involved in social bonding, particularly amongst primates. We hypothesise that a positive association exists between activity of the $\mu$-opioid system and the number of social relationships that an individual maintains. Given the powerful analgesic properties of $\beta$-endorphin, we tested this hypothesis using pain tolerance as an assay for activation of the endogenous $\mu$-opioid system. We show that a simple measure of pain tolerance correlates with social network size in humans. Our results are in line with previous studies suggesting that $\mu$-opioid receptor signalling has been elaborated beyond its basic function of pain modulation to play an important role in managing our social encounters. The neuroplasticity of the $\mu$-opioid system is of future research interest, especially with respect to psychiatric disorders associated with symptoms of social withdrawal and anhedonia, both of which are strongly modulated by endogenous opioids.},

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: results of EFA indicated that all the scales of the ABQ are unidimensional and showed good internal consistency. The correlations between the sections of the ABQ and the other measures used in the current study were significant and in the expected directions.

abstract = {Happiness has been viewed as a temporary emotional state (e.g., pleasure) and a relatively stable state of being happy (subjective happiness level). As previous studies demonstrated that individuals with high subjective happiness level rated their current affective states more positively when they experience positive events, these two aspects of happiness are interrelated. According to a recent neuroimaging study, the cytosine to thymine single-nucleotide polymorphism of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 gene is associated with sensitivity to positive emotional stimuli. Thus, we hypothesized that our genetic traits, such as the human cannabinoid receptor 1 genotypes, are closely related to the two aspects of happiness. In Experiment 1, 198 healthy volunteers were used to compare the subjective happiness level between cytosine allele carriers and thymine-thymine carriers of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 gene. In Experiment 2, we used positron emission tomography with 20 healthy participants to compare the brain responses to positive emotional stimuli of cytosine allele carriers to that of thymine-thymine carriers. Compared to thymine-thymine carriers, cytosine allele carriers have a higher subjective happiness level. Regression analysis indicated that the cytosine allele is significantly associated with subjective happiness level. The positive mood after watching a positive film was significantly higher for the cytosine allele carriers compared to the thymine-thymine carriers. Positive emotion-related brain region such as the medial prefrontal cortex was significantly activated when the cytosine allele carriers watched the positive film compared to the thyminethymine carriers. Thus, the human cannabinoid receptor 1 genotypes are closely related to two aspects of happiness. Compared to thymine-thymine carriers, the cytosine allele carriers of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 gene, who are sensitive to positive emotional stimuli, exhibited greater magnitude positive emotions when they experienced positive events and had a higher subjective happiness level. {\textcopyright} 2014 Matsunaga et al.},

Paying attention to others' faces and eyes is a cornerstone of human social behavior. The µ-opioid receptor (MOR) system, central to social reward-processing in rodents and primates, has been proposed to mediate the capacity for affiliative reward in humans. We assessed the role of the human MOR system in visual exploration of faces and eyes of conspecifics. Thirty healthy males received a novel, bidirectional battery of psychopharmacological treatment (an MOR agonist, a non-selective opioid antagonist, or placebo, on three separate days). Eye-movements were recorded while participants viewed facial photographs. We predicted that the MOR system would promote visual exploration of faces, and hypothesized that MOR agonism would increase, whereas antagonism decrease overt attention to the information-rich eye region. The expected linear effect of MOR manipulation on visual attention to the stimuli was observed, such that MOR agonism increased while antagonism decreased visual exploration of faces and overt attention to the eyes. The observed effects suggest that the human MOR system promotes overt visual attention to socially significant cues, in line with theories linking reward value to gaze control and target selection. Enhanced attention to others' faces and eyes represents a putative behavioral mechanism through which the human MOR system promotes social interest.},

abstract = {Simulation theories of empathy hypothesize that empathizing with others' pain shares some common psychological computations with the processing of one's own pain. Support for this perspective has largely relied on functional neuroimaging evidence of an overlap between activations during the experience of physical pain and empathy for other people's pain. Here, we extend the functional overlap perspective to the neurochemical level and test whether a common physical painkiller, acetaminophen (paracetamol), can reduce empathy for another's pain. In two double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, participants rated perceived pain, personal distress and empathic concern in response to reading scenarios about another's physical or social pain, witnessing ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving painful noise blasts. As hypothesized, acetaminophen reduced empathy in response to others' pain. Acetaminophen also reduced the unpleasantness of noise blasts delivered to the participant, which mediated acetaminophen's effects on empathy. Together, these findings suggest that the physical painkiller acetaminophen reduces empathy for pain and provide a new perspective on the neurochemical bases of empathy. Because empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior, these drug-induced reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side effects of acetaminophen, which is taken by almost a quarter of adults in the United States each week.},

VTA GABA inputs synapse directly onto DA neurons and may regulate DA neuronal activity to alter reward-related behaviors; however, the functional consequences of selective activation of VTA GABA neurons remains unknown. Here, we show that in vivo optogenetic activation of VTA GABA neurons disrupts reward consummatory behavior but not conditioned anticipatory behavior in response to reward-predictive cues. In addition, direct activation of VTA GABA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) resulted in detectable GABA release but did not alter reward consumption. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of VTA GABA neurons directly suppressed the activity and excitability of neighboring DA neurons as well as the release of DA in the NAc, suggesting that the dynamic interplay between VTA DA and GABA neurons can control the initiation and termination of reward-related behaviors. In this paper, van Zessen et al. show that in vivo activation of VTA GABAergic neurons inhibits VTA dopaminergic neurons and disrupts reward consummatory behavior but not conditioned approach behavior.

abstract = {Abstract The present work explores the hostile tendencies elicited by romantic rejection in the increasingly common context of online dating. To empirically investigate this issue, we created an ad hoc online dating platform in which fictitious online dating partners romantically rejected heterosexual male and female participants. Results revealed that male?but not female?participants who were rejected by desired dating partners displayed increased hostility. This pattern of findings was consistent across different measures, which considered both aggressive tendencies against the rejecting partners and hostile attitudes against the opposite gender. Further, increased feelings of anger explained the relationship between online romantic rejection and increased male hostility. Our work and its findings have both theoretical and methodological implications for the understanding of interpersonal processes in online interactions and the growing body of literature on online dating.},

abstract = {Loneliness is a distressing state indicating that one's basic need for social connection is not being met. In an effort to satisfy the need for social connection, loneliness may increase the processing of social cues and desire to connect with others. Yet the neural substrates that contribute to the drive for increased connection in response to loneliness are not known. The ventral striatum (VS), previously shown to increase in response to craving food and other rewarding stimuli, may contribute to "social craving" when one is lonely. That is, the VS may track one's 'hunger' for reconnection much as it tracks hunger for food. To examine this, participants reported on their feelings of loneliness before undergoing an fMRI scan where they viewed cues of potential social reconnection (images of a close other). Consistent with the hypothesis that loneliness stems from an unmet need for connection, loneliness was associated with reduced feelings of connection with the close other. Furthermore, greater reported loneliness was associated with increased VS activity to viewing a close other (vs stranger). Results extend the current literature by showing that lonely individuals show increased activity in reward-related regions to their closest loved ones, possibly reflecting an increased desire for social connection.},

abstract = {Abstract The present study was designed to investigate the rewarding effect, G-protein activation and dopamine (DA) release following partial sciatic nerve ligation in the rat. Here we show for the first time that morphine failed to produce a place preference in rats with nerve injury. Various studies provide arguments to support that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, which projects from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (N.Acc), is critical of the motivational effects of opioids. In the present study, there were no significant differences between sham-operated and sciatic nerve-ligated rats in the increases in guanosine-5?-o-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTP?S) binding to membranes of the N.Acc stimulated by either DA, the D1 receptor agonist SKF81297, the D2 receptor agonist N-propylnoraporphine or the D3 receptor agonist 7-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin (7-OH DPAT). In contrast, the increases in [35S]GTP?S binding to membranes of the VTA induced by either morphine or a selective µ-opioid receptor agonist [d-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly(ol)5]enkephalin were significantly attenuated in nerve-ligated rats as compared with sham- operated rats. Furthermore, the enhancement of DA release in the N.Acc stimulated by morphine was significantly suppressed by sciatic nerve ligation. These findings suggest that attenuation of the morphine-induced place preference under neuropathic pain may result from a decrease in the morphine-induced DA release in the N.Acc with reduction in the µ-opioid receptor-mediated G-protein activation in the VTA.},

Using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, we sought to visualize functional activation of these regions in 12 normal volunteers as they anticipated and responded for monetary incentives. Both individual and group analyses of time-series data revealed significant activation of striatal and mesial forebrain structures (including insula, caudate, putamen, and mesial prefrontal cortex) during trials involving both monetary rewards and punishments. In addition to these areas, during trials involving punishment, group analysis revealed activation foci in the anterior cingulate and thalamus. These results corroborate comparative studies which implicate striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the elaboration of incentive-driven behavior. This report also introduces a new paradigm for probing the functional integrity of this circuitry in humans.},

Despite the importance of social connection for many important outcomes, few researchers have experimentally examined how humans connect with those to whom they feel close. The strongest insights into the biological bases of social connection come from animal research, which shows that social bonds rely on the same neurochemicals that support general motivation. One class of neurochemicals, opioids, has received increased attention in recent years with the rise of pharmacological methods to manipulate opioids in humans. This article reviews emerging findings to show that opioids affect social feelings, behaviors, and perceptions in both positive and negative social experiences and concludes with the implications of such findings. Future work should consider the subjective feelings of social connection felt during interactions with close social contacts in order to further the understanding of social connection.},

We used positron emission tomography scanning with the selective MOR radioligand [ 11 C]carfentanil to test the hypothesis that MOR system activation (reflecting endogenous opioid release) in response to social rejection and acceptance is altered in medication-free patients diagnosed with current major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 17) compared with healthy controls (HCs, n = 18). During rejection, MDD patients showed reduced endogenous opioid release in brain regions regulating stress, mood and motivation, and slower emotional recovery compared with HCs. During acceptance, only HCs showed increased social motivation, which was positively correlated with endogenous opioid release in the nucleus accumbens, a reward structure. Altered endogenous opioid activity in MDD may hinder emotional recovery from negative social interactions and decrease pleasure derived from positive interactions. Both effects may reinforce depression, trigger relapse and contribute to poor treatment outcomes.},

abstract = {Romantic rejection causes a profound sense of loss and negative affect. It can induce clinical depression and in extreme cases lead to suicide and/or homicide. To begin to identify the neural systems associated with this natural loss state, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study 10 women and 5 men who had recently been rejected by a partner but reported they were still intensely ?in love.? Participants alternately viewed a photograph of their rejecting beloved and a photograph of a familiar, individual, interspersed with a distraction-attention task. Their responses while looking at their rejecter included love, despair, good, and bad memories, and wondering why this happened. Activation specific to the image of the beloved occurred in areas associated with gains and losses, craving and emotion regulation and included the ventral tegmental area (VTA) bilaterally, ventral striatum, medial and lateral orbitofrontal/prefrontal cortex, and cingulate gyrus. Compared with data from happily-in-love individuals, the regional VTA activation suggests that mesolimbic reward/survival systems are involved in romantic passion regardless of whether one is happily or unhappily in love. Forebrain activations associated with motivational relevance, gain/loss, cocaine craving, addiction, and emotion regulation suggest that higher-order systems subject to experience and learning also may mediate the rejection reaction. The results show activation of reward systems, previously identified by monetary stimuli, in a natural, endogenous, negative emotion state. Activation of areas involved in cocaine addiction may help explain the obsessive behaviors associated with rejection in love.},

abstract = {The effect of a mild footshock on intravenous heroin self-administration was examined in male rats. Animals in the stress condition were exposed to 10 min of intermittent footshock (0.5 mA; 0.5 s on, with a mean off period of 40 s) before each of four daily self-administration sessions. Animals in the control group were not exposed to footshock. Following acquisition of heroin-reinforced behavior (100 µg/kg per infusion), during which no group differences emerged, animals were placed on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement and were subsequently tested under a decreasing series of doses. Animals exposed to footshock before each drug session had higher rates of lever pressing for heroin and achieved higher final ratios on the progressive ratio schedule than animals in the control group at the higher doses of heroin. Thus, under the conditions of this experiment, exposture to mild intermittent stress appeared to enhance the reinforcing efficacy of heroin. The parameters of footshock used in the present study, and its relation to drug availability may characterize conditions under which stress leads to increased opioid abuse.},

Further, interpersonal ties, support and aspects of the social environment can impair or promote effective adaptation to chronic pain through changes in pain perception, coping and emotional states.

Independent groups were allowed to lever-press for ventral tegmental area (VTA) microinfusions of morphine, the selective mu agonist [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4-Gly5-ol]- enkephalin (DAMGO), the selective delta-agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]- enkephalin (DPDPE), or ineffective drug vehicle. Morphine, DAMGO, and DPDPE were each effective in establishing and maintaining lever- pressing habits. Lever-pressing responses were extinguished during a session when vehicle was substituted for drug, and reinstated when drug reinforcement was reestablished. Thus, it appears that VTA mu- and delta-opioid receptors are each involved in reinforcement of opiate self-administration. The effective dose of DAMGO--both for establishing and for maintaining the lever-press habit--was 100 times lower than the effective doses for DPDPE and morphine, suggesting that the major contribution of VTA mechanisms to intravenous heroin self- administration involves an action on mu-opioid receptors},

abstract = {Both morphine and selective opioid receptor agonists produce typical biphasic effects upon activity in male rats with initial reductions in activity followed by subsequent increases in activity. Sex differences have been observed in a number of opioid-mediated responses, including the observation that microinjection of the opioid peptide, $\beta$-endorphin into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) produces more pronounced analgesia in male rats relative to female rats. The present study evaluated whether $\beta$-endorphin (5.2-26 $\mu$g) in the vlPAG produced biphasic activity effects in male and female rats. Both male and female rats displayed initial reductions in total, ambulatory, and stereotypic activity following $\beta$-endorphin in the vlPAG. Whereas male rats displayed subsequent (90-120 min) increases in total and ambulatory activity following $\beta$-endorphin in the vlpAG, female rats tested during the estrous stage of their estrous cycle failed to display any changes. These sex differences in the opioid modulation in the pattern of activity measures in the vlPAG are discussed in terms of the roles of sex hormones in opioid peptide processing within the vlPAG.

abstract = {Opioid and psychostimulant drugs have long been used for the relief of chronic pain in the clinical situation. Animal studies confirm that these drugs alleviate persistent or tonic pain. Little is known, however, about the neural systems underlying the suppression of tonic pain except that they are different from those mediating the suppression of phasic (i.e., sharp and short-lasting) pain. Although spinal and brainstem-descending pain suppression mechanisms play a role in mediating the inhibition of tonic pain, it appears that this response is additionally mediated by the activation of mechanisms lying rostral to the brainstem. Recent studies suggest that the activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons, arising from the cell bodies of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), plays an important role in mediating the suppression of tonic pain. Other studies suggest that this pain-suppression system involving the activation of mesolimbic DA neurons is naturally triggered by exposure to stress, through the endogenous release of opioids and substance P (SP) in the midbrain.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The British Pharmacological Society. Emotions are states of vigilant readiness that guide human and animal behaviour during survival-salient situations. Categorical models of emotions posit neurally and physiologically distinct basic human emotions (anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness and surprise) that govern different survival functions. Opioid receptors are expressed abundantly in the mammalian emotion circuit, and the opioid system modulates a variety of functions related to arousal and motivation. Yet, its specific contribution to different basic emotions has remained poorly understood. Here, we review how the endogenous opioid system and particularly the $\mu$ receptor contribute to emotional processing in humans. Activation of the endogenous opioid system is consistently associated with both pleasant and unpleasant emotions. In general, exogenous opioid agonists facilitate approach-oriented emotions (anger, pleasure) and inhibit avoidance-oriented emotions (fear, sadness). Opioids also modulate social bonding and affiliative behaviour, and prolonged opioid abuse may render both social bonding and emotion recognition circuits dysfunctional. However, there is no clear evidence that the opioid system is able to affect the emotions associated with surprise and disgust. Taken together, the opioid systems contribute to a wide array of positive and negative emotions through their general ability to modulate the approach versus avoidance motivation associated with specific emotions. Because of the protective effects of opioid system-mediated prosociality and positive mood, the opioid system may constitute an important factor contributing to psychological and psychosomatic resilience.},

Three types of pain are distinguished in this article: Physical pain, an aversive state related to actual or potential injury and disease; social pain, an aversive emotion associated to social exclusion; and psychological pain, a negative emotion induced by incentive loss. This review centers on psychological pain as studied in nonhuman animals. After covering issues of terminology, the article briefly discusses the daily-life significance of psychological pain and then centers on a discussion of the results originating from two procedures involving incentive loss: successive negative contrast-the unexpected devaluation of a reward-and appetitive extinction-the unexpected omission of a reward. The evidence reviewed points to substantial commonalities, but also some differences and interactions between physical and psychological pains. This evidence is discussed in relation to behavioral, pharmacological, neurobiological, and genetic factors that contribute to the multidimensional experience of psychological pain.},

abstract = {Background The importance of neonatal experience upon behaviour in later life is increasingly recognised. The overlap between pain and reward pathways led us to hypothesise that neonatal pain experience influences reward-related pathways and behaviours in adulthood. Methodology/Principal Findings Rat pups received repeat plantar skin incisions (neonatal IN) or control procedures (neonatal anesthesia only, AN) at postnatal days (P)3, 10 and 17. When adult, rats with neonatal ‘pain history' showed greater sensory sensitivity than control rats following acute plantar skin incision. Motivational behaviour in the two groups of rats was tested in a novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) paradigm. The sensitivity of this paradigm to pain-induced changes in motivational behaviour was shown by significant increases in the time spent in the central zone of the arena (43.7±5.9% vs. 22.5±6.7%, p<0.05), close to centrally placed food treats, and decreased number of rears (9.5±1.4 vs. 19.2±2.3, p<0.001) in rats with acute plantar skin incision compared to naive, uninjured animals. Rats with a neonatal ‘pain history' showed the same pain-induced behaviour in the novelty-induced hypophagia paradigm as controls. However, differences were observed in reward-related neural activity between the two groups. Two hours after behavioural testing, brains were harvested and neuronal activity mapped using c-Fos expression in lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons, part of a specific reward seeking pathway. Pain-induced activity in orexin neurons of control rats (18.4±2.8%) was the same as in uninjured naive animals (15.5±2.6%), but in those rats with a ‘pain history', orexinergic activity was significantly increased (27.2±4.1%, p<0.01). Furthermore the extent of orexin neuron activation in individual rats with a ‘pain history' was highly correlated with their motivational behaviour (r = −0.86, p = 0.01). Conclusions/Significance These results show that acute pain alters motivational behaviour and that neonatal pain experience causes long-term changes in brain motivational orexinergic pathways, known to modulate mesolimbic dopaminergic reward circuitry.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Pain and reward have been suggested to interact, and some evidence is provided by a rodent study showing that acutely injured animals are more motivated to reach a food reward while they do not increase food consumption, pointing at unaltered reward liking. Since no data exist in humans, we conducted a psychophysical experiment to test the effects of experimentally induced tonic pain on (1) the motivation to receive reward and (2) hedonic responses when being rewarded. Methods Forty healthy participants underwent two experimental sessions: in one, painful heat stimulation was continuously applied while participants played a monetary reward task; in the other, participants experienced non-painful warm stimulation while playing the task. In the task, participants needed to react quickly enough to a target cue to win the money associated with the particular trial ($0.04, $1 or $4). Reaction time to the target cue served as measure of motivation. Ratings after each trial on how much the participant liked the trial's outcome served as a measure of hedonic responses. Results Pain increased the motivation to obtain reward when the incentive was high, indexed by decreased reaction times (repeated-measures analysis of variance, interaction pain???incentive; p?=?0.009). In contrast to motivational drive, hedonic ratings of the rewarding stimuli were not influenced by pain. Conclusion Similar to existing rodent data, our results suggest a pain-induced mismatch of increased motivational drive with a lack of increased hedonic responses. This mismatch is discussed as perhaps reflecting a failed coping attempt, which is potentially relevant for chronic pain patients.},

abstract = {Placebo analgesia is the beneficial effect that follows despite a pharmacologically inert treatment. Modern neuroimaging studies in humans have delineated the hierarchical brain regions involved in placebo analgesia. However, because of the lack of proper approaches to perform molecular and cellular manipulations, the detailed molecular processes behind it have not been clarified. To address this issue, we developed an animal model of placebo analgesia in rats and analyzed the placebo analgesia related brain activity using small-animal neuroimaging method. We show here that gabapentin-based Pavlovian conditioning successfully induced placebo analgesia in neuropathic pain model rats and hierarchical brain regions are involved in placebo analgesia in rats, including the prelimbic cortex (PrL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG), etc. The functional couplings in placebo responders between the mPFC and vlPAG was interrupted by naloxone, an antagonist of $\mu$ opioid receptor. Moreover, both local chemical lesion and microinfusion of naloxone in the mPFC suppressed the placebo analgesia. These results suggest that the intrinsic $\mu$ opioid system in the mPFC causally contribute to placebo analgesia in rats, and the small-animal neuroimaging approach could provide important insights toward understanding the placebo effect in great detail.},

abstract = {Pleasure is mediated by well-developed mesocorticolimbic circuitry and serves adaptive functions. In affective disorders, anhedonia (lack of pleasure) or dysphoria (negative affect) can result from breakdowns of that hedonic system. Human neuroimaging studies indicate that surprisingly similar circuitry is activated by quite diverse pleasures, suggesting a common neural currency shared by all. Wanting for reward is generated by a large and distributed brain system. Liking, or pleasure itself, is generated by a smaller set of hedonic hot spots within limbic circuitry. Those hot spots also can be embedded in broader anatomical patterns of valence organization, such as in a keyboard pattern of nucleus accumbens generators for desire versus dread. In contrast, some of the best known textbook candidates for pleasure generators, including classic pleasure electrodes and the mesolimbic dopamine system, may not generate pleasure after all. These emerging insights into brain pleasure mechanisms may eventually facilitate better treatments for affective disorders. How does pleasure arise in the brain? Solving that puzzle is a major goal for affective neuroscience. Berridge and Kringelbach assess what is currently known about how brain limbic systems encode and cause pleasure versus displeasure.},

FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5), which influences HPA axis activity via glucocorticoid receptors, is supposed to play an important role in the regulation of negative feedback and glucocorticoid resistance. Since ineffective stress response mechanisms are considered as a biological background of suicide behavior, we aimed to analyze a possible association between FKBP5 functional polymorphisms and completed suicide. METHODS The selected FKBP5 polymorphisms rs1360780 and rs3800373 were genotyped in a sample of 563 suicide victims and 475 controls. RESULTS A significant association between the high-induction rs3800373 C allele and completed suicide was detected (OR = 1.36, p = 0.007). In this polymorphism, genotype distribution supported a codominant model of inheritance. The analyzed SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.916 and r2 = 0.826) with the rs1360780 (T)-rs3800373 (C) haplotype apparently responsible for the observed association (OR = 1.34, p = 0.010). CONCLUSION The results of the present study indicate that genetic alterations in FKBP5 may influence vulnerability to suicide.},

abstract = {Rewards are both "liked" and "wanted," and those 2 words seem almost interchangeable. However, the brain circuitry that mediates the psychological process of "wanting" a particular reward is dissociable from circuitry that mediates the degree to which it is "liked." Incentive salience or "wanting," a form of motivation, is generated by large and robust neural systems that include mesolimbic dopamine. By comparison, "liking," or the actual pleasurable impact of reward consumption, is mediated by smaller and fragile neural systems, and is not dependent on dopamine. The incentive-sensitization theory posits the essence of drug addiction to be excessive amplification specifically of psychological "wanting," especially triggered by cues, without necessarily an amplification of "liking." This is because of long-lasting changes in dopamine-related motivation systems of susceptible individuals, called "neural sensitization." A quarter-century after its proposal, evidence has continued to grow in support the incentive-sensitization theory. Further, its scope is now expanding to include diverse behavioral addictions and other psychopathologies. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Consequently, ostracism may induce strong negative feelings of social exclusion. Recent studies suggest that slow, affective touch, which is mediated by a separate, specific C tactile neurophysiological system than faster, neutral touch, modulates the perception of physical pain. However, it remains unknown whether slow, affective touch, can also reduce feelings of social exclusion, a form of social pain. Here, we employed a social exclusion paradigm, namely the Cyberball task (N = 84), to examine whether the administration of slow, affective touch may reduce the negative feelings of ostracism induced by the social exclusion manipulations of the Cyberball task. As predicted, the provision of slow-affective, as compared to fast-neutral, touch led to a specific decrease in feelings of social exclusion, beyond general mood effects. These findings point to the soothing function of slow, affective touch, particularly in the context of social separation or rejection, and suggest a specific relation between affective touch and social bonding.},

abstract = {Objective: Physical pain is considered a potential predictor of relapse in alcohol-dependent individuals after treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether reductions in pain level during the follow-up period after treatment were associated with lower relapse risk. Method: A sample of 366 participants was recruited from alcohol treatment centers in Warsaw, Poland. At baseline, information was obtained about pain level, demographics, childhood abuse, impulsivity, depressive symptoms, severity of alcohol and sleep problems. After finishing the alcohol treatment program, patients were followed for 12 months and alcohol drinking (relapse) as well as pain severity were evaluated. Results: In the followed-up group, 29.5% of patients confirmed that they drank any alcohol during past 4 weeks. Comparing follow-up to baseline pain, 48.6% of subjects reported an increased severity of pain, 28.8% reported the same level of pain, 22.6% reported decreased level of pain. There was a significant association between the decrease in level of pain and the lower risk of relapse. Other factors associated with relapse during 4 weeks prior to the follow-up were baseline severity of depressive symptoms, low baseline social support and number of drinking days during 4 weeks prior to entering treatment. In multivariate analysis, a decrease in pain level was associated with a lower likelihood of relapse (OR = 0.159; 95%CI:0.04-0.62; p = 0.008) even when controlled for other factors associated with relapse. Conclusions: Decreases in pain level following treatment for alcohol dependence are associated with, and may contribute to, a lower risk of alcohol relapse.},

abstract = {Studies of the brain mechanisms of addictive drug actions suggest a two-factor model of addiction. First, all addictive substances are argued to have psychomotor stimulant properties that reflect their activation, at one or more levels, of a common neural mechanism of positive reinforcement. These effects are seen as the biological basis of "psychological" dependence and as the basis for drug cravings that are not rooted in withdrawal symptoms or some other form of distress. Second, at least some addictive substances are thought to activate mechanisms that suppress pain and distress signals, including those associated with the drug's own withdrawal symptoms. These effects represent negative reinforcement effects that, when they occur, can contribute further to the habit-forming impact of a drug and to drug cravings. The brain mechanisms of positive and negative reinforcement are anatomically and functionally distinct, at least in the case of the opiates (on which the concept of physiological dependence is largely modeled). Separate consideration of drug-induced positive and negative reinforcement suggests several new perspectives on the acquisition and extinction of drug habits},

abstract = {Numerous research groups are now using analysis of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results and relaying back information about regional activity in their brains to participants in the scanner in 'real time'. In this study, we explored the feasibility of self-regulation of frontal cortical activation using real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback in nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers during exposure to smoking cues. Ten cigarette smokers were shown smoking-related visual cues in a 3 Tesla MRI scanner to induce their nicotine craving. Participants were instructed to modify their craving using rtfMRI feedback with two different approaches. In a 'reduce craving' paradigm, participants were instructed to 'reduce' their craving, and decrease the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity. In a separate 'increase resistance' paradigm, participants were asked to increase their resistance to craving and to increase middle prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity. We found that participants were able to significantly reduce the BOLD signal in the ACC during the 'reduce craving' task (P=0.028). There was a significant correlation between decreased ACC activation and reduced craving ratings during the 'reduce craving' session (P=0.011). In contrast, there was no modulation of the BOLD signal in mPFC during the 'increase resistance' session. These preliminary results suggest that some smokers may be able to use neurofeedback via rtfMRI to voluntarily regulate ACC activation and temporarily reduce smoking cue-induced craving. Further research is needed to determine the optimal parameters of neurofeedback rtfMRI, and whether it might eventually become a therapeutic tool for nicotine dependence.},

abstract = {In healthy individuals, food cues can trigger hunger and feeding behavior. Likewise, smoking cues can trigger craving and relapse in smokers. Brain imaging studies report that structures involved in appetitive behaviors and reward, notably the insula, striatum, amygdala and orbital frontal cortex, tend to be activated by both visual food and smoking cues. Here, by carrying out a meta-analysis of human neuro-imaging studies, we investigate the neural network activated by: 1) food versus neutral cues (14 studies, 142 foci) 2) smoking versus neutral cues (15 studies, 176 foci) 3) smoking versus neutral cues when correlated with craving scores (7 studies, 108 foci).PubMed was used to identify cue-reactivity imaging studies that compared brain response to visual food or smoking cues to neutral cues. Fourteen articles were identified for the food meta-analysis and fifteen articles were identified for the smoking meta-analysis. Six articles were identified for the smoking cue correlated with craving analysis. Meta-analyses were carried out using activation likelihood estimation.Food cues were associated with increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left amygdala, bilateral insula, bilateral orbital frontal cortex, and striatum. Smoking cues were associated with increased BOLD signal in the same areas, with the exception of the insula. However, the smoking meta-analysis of brain maps correlating cue-reactivity with subjective craving did identify the insula, suggesting that insula activation is only found when craving levels are high. The brain areas identified here are involved in learning, memory and motivation, and their cue-induced activity is an index of the incentive salience of the cues.Using meta-analytic techniques to combine a series of studies, we found that food and smoking cues activate comparable brain networks. There is significant overlap in brain regions responding to conditioned cues associated with natural and drug rewards. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {It is well known that depressive disorder is heterogeneous, yet little is known about its neurophysiological subtypes. In the present study, we identified neurophysiological subtypes of depression related to specific neural substrates. We performed cluster analysis for 134 subjects (67 depressive subjects and 67 controls) using a high-dimensional dataset consisting of resting state functional connectivity measured by functional MRI, clinical questionnaire scores, and various biomarkers. Applying a newly developed, multiple co-clustering method to this dataset, we identified three subtypes of depression that are characterized by functional connectivity between the right Angular Gyrus (AG) and other brain areas in default mode networks, and Child Abuse Trauma Scale (CATS) scores. These subtypes are also related to Selective Serotonin-Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) treatment outcomes, which implies that we may be able to predict effectiveness of treatment based on AG-related functional connectivity and CATS. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, but serious disorder, characterized by severe symptoms that affect how one feels, thinks, and manages daily activities 1. It is estimated that 17% of all people experience MDD at one point or another during their lifetimes 2. Despite its prevalence, however, clinical diagnosis is rather limited, and is based on highly subjective criteria. Current diagnostic practice relies on clinical questionnaires in which patients reply to questions on a wide range of depression-related items listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disease (DSM) 3. Although DSM provides a coherent framework for diagnosis, it remains subjective due to its dependence on patient responses. In addition to subjectiveness, diagnosis involves time-consuming interviews , which require both professional medical expertise and close cooperation of a patient 4. To improve diagnostic objectivity, much attention has recently been paid to potential biomarkers for depression. In particular, a number of studies have focused on neural activities in the brain, measured as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals 5-7. Typically, relevant brain areas for depression are identified in a supervised manner, i.e., using labels of control/depression that are subsequently evaluated for diagnosis of depression in a test dataset. In this framework, the binary label of control/depression plays a key role in identification of these brain areas. A more challenging problem in MDD is the identification of its subtypes. It is well known that MDD is het-erogenous in such characteristics as clinical presentation, progression, treatment response, genetics, and neu-robiology 8. This heterogeneity hampers progress in identifying the cause of MDD and its effective treatment 9. To overcome this problem, several studies have been conducted to identify subtypes of MDD in a data-driven manner, relying on clinical questionnaires 10,11. However, the results of these studies either conflict or they simply identify clusters related to depression severity, which does not provide conclusive evidence for subtypes of depres-sive symptoms 8. Furthermore, these studies are based on clinical questionnaires without taking into account biological substrates. Recently, resting state fMRI, in which a subject does not explicitly perform any task, has increasingly gained attention for MDD prediction 12,13. Further, several studies using resting state fMRI have shed light on MDD sub-types in terms of treatment resistance 14 .},

To investigate the functional consequences of such opioid receptor changes, adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in rat nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen following continuous cocaine administration (50 mg/kg/day, 7 days). In the nucleus accumbens chronic cocaine led to an increase in both the number of $\mu$-opioid receptors and the maximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by DAMGO ([D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Glyol]enkephalin). There was no effect on inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by DPDPE ([D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin). There were no changes in the caudate putamen. Thus, continuous cocaine administration for 7 days results in a selective increase in $\mu$-opioid receptor-mediated effector function in the nucleus accumbens.},

abstract = {Previous research in squirrel monkeys has shown enhancement of the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine by mu-opioid agonists, but not by the delta agonist BW373U86. To examine further the role of mu and delta receptor stimulation in the ability of opioid drugs to modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine, the present study assessed the effects of cocaine alone and combined with SNC 80, a selective high-efficacy delta agonist, and fentanyl, a selective high- efficacy mu agonist. Five adult male squirrel monkeys were trained to discriminate i.m. injections of 0.3 mg/kg cocaine from saline under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of food presentation. Cumulative doses of cocaine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) engendered dose-related increases in drug- lever responding to a maximum of 100%, with a decrease in response rate observed at 1.0 mg/kg. Cumulative doses of SNC 80 (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) or fentanyl (0.001-0.01 mg/kg) resulted in a maximum of 22% and 48% drug- lever responding, respectively, accompanied by pronounced decreases in response rate. Administration of either SNC 80 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) or fentanyl (0.001-0.01 mg/kg) prior to cumulative doses of cocaine produced dose-dependent leftward shifts in the cocaine dose-response function. When the selective delta antagonist naltrindole (1.0 mg/kg) was combined with SNC 80 (1.0 mg/kg) or fentanyl (0.01 mg/kg) prior to cumulative doses of cocaine, the leftward shift of the cocaine dose- response function produced by SNC 80 was blocked, whereas the leftward shift produced by fentanyl was not. By contrast, the mu antagonist naltrexone (0.3 mg/kg) blocked the cocaine-enhancing effects of fentanyl, but not of SNC 80. Combinations of SNC 80 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) with fentanyl (0.001-0.003 mg/kg) resulted in leftward shifts in the cocaine dose-response function that were comparable in magnitude to the shifts in the cocaine dose-response function produced by either drug alone. These results suggest that opioid enhancement of the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine is mediated independently by delta- and mu-receptor mechanisms},

abstract = {The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone is known to influence a wide range of behavioral effects of cocaine, including its addictive property. In the present study the effects of different doses of naloxone and naloxone-methyl-iodide, a methylated analogon of naloxone that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, on the action of cocaine in the intravenous self-administration and conditioned place preference (CCP) paradigm were assessed. Systemic naloxone, but not naloxone-methyl-iodide, dose-dependently suppressed cocaine intake during self-administration and decreased the preference for the cocaine-associated compartment in the CCP paradigm. A significant blockade of cocaine's effects was only present at a relatively high dose of NLX (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.). In addition, NLX produced a rightward shift in the inverted U-shaped dose-response curve for cocaine reward during self-administration, indicating a decrease in sensitivity for the reinforcing effects of cocaine. These data demonstrate that blockade of opioid receptors in the brain block both the reinforcing and conditioned motivational effects of cocaine. An interaction between endogenous opioid systems and local dopaminergic systems is suggested in mediating the effects of NLX on cocaine.},

abstract = {Endogenous opioid systems have been impli- cated in experimental cocaine addiction. One aspect of this involvement may be the modulation of the moti- vational properties of cocaine by endogenous opioids. The present study assessed the effect of opioid block- ade with naloxone (NLX) on cocaine's motivational properties using the conditioned place preference pro- cedure. Treatment with doses of NLX that did not induce place aversion (0.01-1.0 mg/kg -1, SC), dose- dependently attenuated place preference induced by cocaine (10 or 20 mg/kg -1, IP). This effect of NLX was present when administered during acquisition of cocaine-induced place preference and when adminis- tered before expression of cocaine's motivational effects. These data support the notion that the (conditioned) motivational properties of cocaine are modulated through activation of opioid systems by endogenous opioid peptides. Furthermore, it is suggested that an interaction between endogenous opioid systems and dopaminergic systems in the brain might be of impor- tance in the motivational facilitation of experimental cocaine addiction.},

abstract = {Behavioural adaptation to and the effects of the neurohypophyseal peptide, oxytocin, on repeated treatment with cocaine were investigated in rats. The content of immunoreactive oxytocin in the plasma, hypothalamus and different limbic structures in the brain were also studied after treatment with cocaine, identical to that used in the behavioural experiment. Repeated administration of cocaine (7.5 mg/kg, s.c.) produced a behavioural tolerance to the stereotyped sniffing-inducing effect of the challenge doses (1.875, 3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg, s.c.) of cocaine on the fifth day, which was demonstrated by parallel shifting of the dose-response and time-effect curves of the test doses of cocaine. The development of tolerance was inhibited by pretreatment with oxytocin (0.05 $\mu$g, s.c.), administered before each daily injection of cocaine. A smaller dose of oxytocin (0.005 $\mu$g, s.c.) had no effect in this model. A decreased amount of immunoreactive oxytocin was detected in the plasma, in the hypothalamus and in the hippocampus, after repeated treatment with cocaine. Replacement of oxytocin by local injection (100pg) into the ventral hippocampus, before each daily administration of cocaine, prevented the development of tolerance to cocaine. These results suggest that endogenous oxytocin, localized in limbic-forebrain areas, may have an important regulatory role in the development of behavioural changes induced by the repeated administration of cocaine. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side effects, the most common of which was lightheadedness. The plasma concentration-time data were best fit with a triexponential equation, and the terminal elimination phase had a harmonic mean t1/2 of 8 to 9 hours. Only about 5% of the dose was excreted in the urine as intact nalmefene, with up to 60% excreted as nalmefene glucuronide. Although intersubject differences were noted, mean or dose-normalized mean kinetic parameters such as clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, terminal t1/2, and AUC showed no consistent trends related to increasing doses, indicating that nalmefene has linear pharmacokinetics.},

Conditioned place preference in wild-type animals was induced with 5.0 mg/kg cocaine and this dose was ineffective in the knockouts. In this group conditioned place preference occurred after injection of 10.0 mg/kg cocaine. Cocaine induced a similar increase in locomotor activity in both groups of mice. There was no difference in dopamine D1 receptor binding, whereas dopamine D2 receptor binding was significantly lower in the hippocampus of deficient animals.

abstract = {An unbiased place preference conditioning procedure was used to identify the central opioid receptor types through which the endogenous opioid peptide, $\beta$-endorphin, acts to exert its reinforcing effects in rats in vivo. The intracerebroventricular administration of $\beta$-endorphin, and selective $\mu$ (DAGO) or $\delta$ (DPDPE) opioid receptor agonists produced marked preferences for the drug-associated place. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with the selective $\mu$ antagonist, CTOP, eliminated the place preference produced by DAGO but not that produced by DPDPE. Pretreatment with the selective $\delta$ antagonist, ICI 174,864, abolished the place preference induced by DPDPE. It did not modify the effect of DAGO. In contrast, pretreatment with either ICI 174,864 or CTOP abolished the effects of $\beta$-endorphin. These data demonstrate that both $\mu$ and $\delta$ receptors are involved in mediating the reinforcing effect of $\beta$-endorphin and indicate that the activation of both receptor types is required for the expression of the motivational effects of $\beta$-endorphin. Further they suggest that $\beta$-endorphin produces its motivational effects via an interaction with an opioid receptor complex composed of both $\mu$ and $\delta$ receptors. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

Despite the long tradition of MOR-targeting drugs, still little is known about the ligand-receptor interactions and structure-function relationships underlying the distinct biological effects upon receptor activation or inhibition. With the resolved crystal structure of the $\beta$-funaltrexamine-MOR complex, we aimed at the discovery of novel agonists and antagonists using virtual screening tools, i.e. docking, pharmacophore- and shape-based modeling. We suggest important molecular interactions, which active molecules share and distinguish agonists and antagonists. These results allowed for the generation of theoretically validated in silico workflows that were employed for prospective virtual screening. Out of 18 virtual hits evaluated in in vitro pharmacological assays, three displayed antagonist activity and the most active compound significantly inhibited morphine-induced antinociception. The new identified chemotypes hold promise for further development into neurochemical tools for studying the MOR or as potential therapeutic lead candidates.},

Results revealed that general and specific components of an expectancy construct predicted cocaine use independently from all other constructs. In addition, a mediational model suggested that expectancies may mediate the effects of certain personality constructs on cocaine use and abuse.

Therefore, comparison of the concordance and discordance between romantic love and drug addiction may elucidate potential treatments for addiction. This focused review uses the evidences from our recent studies to compare the neural alterations between romantic love and drug addiction, moreover we also compare the behavioral and neurochemical alterations between romantic love and drug addiction. From the behavioral comparisons we find that there are many similarities between the early stage of romantic love and drug addiction, and this stage romantic love is considered as a behavioral addiction, while significant differences exist between the later stage of romantic love and drug addiction, and this stage of romantic love eventually developed into a prosocial behavior. The neuroimaging comparisons suggest that romantic love and drug addiction both display the functional enhancement in reward and emotion regulation network. Except the similar neural changes, romantic love display special function enhancement in social cognition network, while drug addiction display special dysfunction in cognitive control network. The neurochemical comparisons show that there are many similarities in the dopamine (DA) system, while significant differences in oxytocin (OT) system for romantic love and drug addiction. These findings indicate that the functional alterations in reward and emotion regulation network and the DA system may be the neurophysiological basis of romantic love as a behavioral addiction, and the functional alterations in social cognition network and the OT system may be the neurophysiological basis of romantic love as a prosocial behavior. It seems that the OT system is a critical factor for the development of addiction. So we then discuss strategies to treat drug addiction with OT, and suggest that future research should further investigate OT system interventions aiming to improve cognitive control and/or social cognition functions, in order to develop strategies designed to more effectively treat drug addiction.},

abstract = {<p>Although several pharmacological options to treat depression are currently available, approximately one third of patients who receive antidepressant medications do not respond adequately or achieve a complete remission. Thus, novel strategies are needed to successfully address those who did not respond, or partially respond, to available antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Research findings revealed that the opioid system is significantly involved in the regulation of mood and incentives salience and may be an appropriate target for novel therapeutic agents. The present study aimed to systematically review the current literature about the use of buprenorphine (BUP) for major depression, treatment-resistant depression (TRD), non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behavior, and suicidal behavior. We investigated Pubmed and Scopus databases using the following keywords: “buprenorphine AND depression”, “buprenorphine AND treatment resistant depression”, “buprenorphine AND suicid*”, “buprenorphine AND refractory depression”. Several evidence demonstrate that, at low doses, BUP is an efficacious, well-tolerated, and safe option in reducing depressive symptoms, serious suicidal ideation, and NSSI, even in patients with TRD. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects, and relative efficacy of specific combinations (e.g., BUP + samidorphan (BUP/SAM), BUP + naloxone (BUP/NAL), BUP + naltrexone) over BUP monotherapy or adjunctive BUP treatment with standard antidepressants, as well as to obtain more uniform guidance about the optimal BUP dosing interval.</p>},

abstract = {Pain, whether caused by physical injury or social rejection, is an inevitable part of life. These two types of pain-physical and social-may rely on some of the same behavioral and neural mechanisms that register pain-related affect. To the extent that these pain processes overlap, acetaminophen, a physical pain suppressant that acts through central (rather than peripheral) neural mechanisms, may also reduce behavioral and neural responses to social rejection. In two experiments, participants took acetaminophen or placebo daily for 3 weeks. Doses of acetaminophen reduced reports of social pain on a daily basis (Experiment 1). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure participants' brain activity (Experiment 2), and found that acetaminophen reduced neural responses to social rejection in brain regions previously associated with distress caused by social pain and the affective component of physical pain (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Thus, acetaminophen reduces behavioral and neural responses associated with the pain of social rejection, demonstrating substantial overlap between social and physical pain.},

A principal component analysis produced a three-factor solution that included gambling as a way to escape negative emotions (Escape), dissociating (Dissociation), and narcissism/seeking attention (Egotism). Multiple regression analyses revealed that being female and general dissociation was associated with Escape gambling. General dissociation was also related to the Dissociation factor.

American (n=176) and Filipino (n=195) students completed a Big Five measure and act frequency ratings for behaviours performed during the past month. Acts for specific traits cohered to an equivalent degree across cultures. In both cultures, the structure of act composites resembled the Big Five and the strength of trait-behaviour relationships was very similar. Many acts were multidimensional and analyses revealed cultural commonalities and differences in the relevance and prevalence of acts for the Big Five traits. The results were more consistent with trait than cultural psychology perspectives, because traits predicted behaviour equally well, on average, in the two cultures.

abstract = {Alcohol addiction is accompanied by aberrant neural activity. Previously, task-based fMRI and resting-state EEG studies have revealed that craving, a critical component of addiction, is linked to abnormal activity in cortical regions including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), etc. In this study, we combine these two imaging techniques to investigate a group of alcohol-addicted patients and provide convergent evidence for the neural correlates of craving not only in alcohol but substance abuse in general. We observe abnormal BOLD signal levels in the dACC, NAcc, pgACC, PCC, amygdala, and parahippocampus (PHC) in a cue-reactivity fMRI experiment. These findings are consistent with increased beta-band activity in the dACC and pgACC in resting-state EEG. We further observe desynchronization characterized by decreased functional connectivity in cue-based fMRI and hypersynchronization characterized by increased functional connectivity between these regions in the theta frequency band. The results of our study show a consistent pattern of alcohol craving elicited by external cues and internal desires. Given the advantage of superior spatial and temporal resolution, we hypothesize a “central craving network” that integrates the different aspects of alcohol addiction into a unified percept.},

The objective of this study was to explore the relationships between self-reported components of emotional intelligence and lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in a clinical sample of AD subjects.METHODSA group of 80 inpatients entering an alcohol treatment program in Warsaw, Poland, was recruited. Baseline information about demographics, psychopathological symptoms, personality, and severity of alcohol problems was obtained. The Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test was utilized for assessment of emotional processing. Lifetime history of suicide attempts was obtained from the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview.RESULTSAfter accounting for affect-related suicide risk factors (severity of depression, anxiety, neuroticism), and also other significant predictors (eg, age, sex, history of childhood abuse), mood regulation/optimism deficits remained a significant correlate of lifetime suicide attempts in AD patients. In the mediation models, mood regulation appeared to fully mediate the relationship between history of suicide attempts and depression, and also neuroticism.CONCLUSIONSThe results of this study support the evidence that poor mood regulation might be related to the risk for suicidal behavior in AD individuals. These findings point towards the significance of addressing the issue of emotion-related skills in the therapy of those AD subjects who are at risk for suicide.},

However, little has been known about these neural mechanisms in human mothers. We examined patterns of maternal brain activation in response to infant cues using video clips. Methods: We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements while 13 mothers viewed video clips, with no sound, of their own infant and other infants of approximately 16 months of age who demonstrated two different attachment behaviors (smiling at the infant's mother and crying for her). Results: We found that a limited number of the mother's brain areas were specifically involved in recognition of the mother's own infant, namely orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), periaqueductal gray, anterior insula, and dorsal and ventrolateral parts of putamen. Additionally, we found the strong and specific mother's brain response for the mother's own infant's distress. The differential neural activation pattern was found in the dorsal region of OFC, caudate nucleus, right inferior frontal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, thalamus, substantia nigra, posterior superior temporal sulcus, and PFC. Conclusions: Our results showed the highly elaborate neural mechanism mediating maternal love and diverse and complex maternal behaviors for vigilant protectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Romantic and maternal love are highly rewarding experiences. Both are linked to the perpetuation of the species and therefore have a closely linked biological function of crucial evolutionary importance. Yet almost nothing is known about their neural correlates in the human. We therefore used fMRI to measure brain activity in mothers while they viewed pictures of their own and of acquainted children, and of their best friend and of acquainted adults as additional controls. The activity specific to maternal attachment was compared to that associated to romantic love described in our earlier study and to the distribution of attachment-mediating neurohormones established by other studies. Both types of attachment activated regions specific to each, as well as overlapping regions in the brain's reward system that coincide with areas rich in oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Both deactivated a common set of regions associated with negative emotions, social judgment and 'mentalizing', that is, the assessment of other people's intentions and emotions. We conclude that human attachment employs a push-pull mechanism that overcomes social distance by deactivating networks used for critical social assessment and negative emotions, while it bonds individuals through the involvement of the reward circuitry, explaining the power of love to motivate and exhilarate. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In some cases acute or chronic stress leads to depression and other psychiatric disorders, but most people are resilient to such effects.

These changes shape the functioning of the neural circuits that regulate reward, fear, emotion reactivity and social behaviour, which together are thought to mediate successful coping with stress.},

abstract = {The midbrain central gray (periaqueductal gray; PAG) mediates defensive behaviors and is implicated in the rewarding effects of opiate drugs. Projections from the PAG to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) suggest that this region might also regulate behaviors involving motivation and cognition. However, studies have not yet examined the morphological features of PAG axons in the VTA or whether they synapse onto dopamine (DA) or GABA neurons. In this study, we injected anterograde tracers into the rat PAG and used immunoperoxidase to visualize the projections to the VTA. Immunogold-silver labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or GABA was then used to identify the phenotype of innervated cells. Electron microscopic examination of the VTA revealed axons labeled anterogradely from the PAG, including myelinated and unmyelinated fibers and axon varicosities, some of which formed identifiable synapses. Approximately 55% of these synaptic contacts were of the symmetric (presumably inhibitory) type; the rest were asymmetric (presumably excitatory). These findings are consistent with the presence of both GABA and glutamate projection neurons in the PAG. Some PAG axons contained dense-cored vesicles indicating the presence of neuropeptides in addition to classical neurotransmitters. PAG projections synapsed onto both DA and GABA cells with no obvious selectivity, providing the first anatomical evidence for these direct connections. The results suggest a diverse nature of PAG physiological actions on midbrain neurons. Moreover, as both the VTA and PAG are implicated in the reinforcing actions of opiates, our findings provide a potential substrate for some of the rewarding effects of these drugs.},

abstract = {Although data from both animals and humans suggests that adult cocaine use can have long term effects on behavior, it is unknown if prior cocaine use affects future maternal behavior in nulliparous females. In the current study, cocaine or saline was administered to adult female rats for 10 days, the animals were withdrawn from cocaine for 7 days, and the females were then exposed to donor pups to induce the expression of maternal behavior. Nulliparous females sensitized to cocaine were more likely to retrieve pups, spent more time caring for the pups, and were more likely to express full maternal behavior on day 8 of pup exposure. The fMRI data revealed significant effects of pup exposure in the hippocampal CA1 region, and effects of cocaine in the anterior thalamus and periaqueductal gray. Prior adult cocaine use may have lasting effects on offspring care, and this effect is not dependent on pup mediated effects or the endocrine changes of gestation and lactation. The present findings provide support for the hypothesis that maternal motivation to exhibit maternal behavior is enhanced by prior cocaine sensitization, possibly due to cross sensitization between cocaine and the natural reward of maternal behavior.},

abstract = {Individuals in the early stage of intense romantic love show many symptoms of substance and non-substance or behavioral addictions, including euphoria, craving, tolerance, emotional and physical dependence, withdrawal and relapse. We have proposed that romantic love is a natural (and often positive) addiction that evolved from mammalian antecedents by 4 million years ago as a survival mechanism to encourage hominin pair-bonding and reproduction, seen cross-culturally today in Homo sapiens. Brain scanning studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging support this view: feelings of intense romantic love engage regions of the brain's "reward system," specifically dopamine-rich regions, including the ventral tegmental area, also activated during drug and/or behavioral addiction. Thus, because the experience of romantic love shares reward pathways with a range of substance and behavioral addictions, it may influence the drug and/or behavioral addiction response. Indeed, a study of overnight abstinent smokers has shown that feelings of intense romantic love attenuate brain activity associated with cigarette cue-reactivity. Could socially rewarding experiences be therapeutic for drug and/or behavioral addictions? We suggest that "self expanding" experiences like romance and expanding one's knowledge, experience and self-perception, may also affect drug and/or behavioral addiction behaviors. Further, because feelings of romantic love can progress into feelings of calm attachment, and because attachment engages more plastic forebrain regions, there is a rationale for therapies that may help substance and/or behavioral addiction by promoting activation of these forebrain systems through long-term, calm, positive attachments to others, including group therapies. Addiction is considered a negative (harmful) disorder that appears in a population subset; while romantic love is often a positive (as well as negative) state experienced by almost all humans. Thus, researchers have not categorized romantic love as a chemical or behavioral addiction. But by embracing data on romantic love, it's classification as an evolved, natural, often positive but also powerfully negative addiction, and its neural similarity to many substance and non-substance addictive states, clinicians may develop more effective therapeutic approaches to alleviate a range of the addictions, including heartbreak-an almost universal human experience that can trigger stalking, clinical depression, suicide, homicide, and other crimes of passion.},

abstract = {Mammals and birds regularly express mate preferences and make mate choices. Data on mate choice among mammals suggest that this behavioural 'attraction system' is associated with dopaminergic reward pathways in the brain. It has been proposed that intense romantic love, a human cross-cultural universal, is a developed form of this attraction system. To begin to determine the neural mechanisms associated with romantic attraction in humans, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study 17 people who were intensely 'in love'. Activation specific to the beloved occurred in the brainstem right ventral tegmental area and right postero-dorsal body of the caudate nucleus. These and other results suggest that dopaminergic reward and motivation pathways contribute to aspects of romantic love. We also used fMRI to study 15 men and women who had just been rejected in love. Preliminary analysis showed activity specific to the beloved in related regions of the reward system associated with monetary gambling for uncertain large gains and losses, and in regions of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex associated with theory of mind, obsessive/compulsive behaviours and controlling anger. These data contribute to our view that romantic love is one of the three primary brain systems that evolved in avian and mammalian species to direct reproduction. The sex drive evolved to motivate individuals to seek a range of mating partners; attraction evolved to motivate individuals to prefer and pursue specific partners; and attachment evolved to motivate individuals to remain together long enough to complete species-specific parenting duties. These three behavioural repertoires appear to be based on brain systems that are largely distinct yet interrelated, and they interact in specific ways to orchestrate reproduction, using both hormones and monoamines. Romantic attraction in humans and its antecedent in other mammalian species play a primary role: this neural mechanism motivates individuals to focus their courtship energy on specific others, thereby conserving valuable time and metabolic energy, and facilitating mate choice.},

abstract = {Cocaine use activates the dopamine reward pathway, leading to the reinforcing effects of dopamine. There is no FDA-approved medication for treating cocaine dependence. Opioid agonists and antagonists have been approved for treating opioid and alcohol dependence. Agonists that activate the $\mu$ opioid receptor increase dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, while $\mu$ receptor antagonists decrease dopamine levels by blocking the effects of endogenous opioid peptides. Activation of the $\kappa$ opioid receptor decreases dopamine levels and leads to dysphoria. In contrast, inhibition of the $\kappa$ opioid receptor decreases dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. Antagonists acting at the $\kappa$ receptor reduce stress-mediated behaviors and anxiety. Mixed partial $\mu$/$\kappa$ agonists have the potential of striking a balance between dopamine levels and attenuating relapse to cocaine. The pharmacological properties of mixed $\mu$/$\kappa$ opioid receptor agonists will be discussed and results from clinical and preclinical studies will be presented. Results from studies with some of the classical benzomorphans and morphinans will be presented as they lay the foundation for structure-activity relationships. Recent results with other partial opioid agonists, including buprenorphine derivatives and the mixed $\mu$/$\kappa$ peptide CJ-15,208, will be discussed. The behavioral effects of the mixed $\mu$/$\kappa$ MCL-741, an aminothiazolomorphinan, in attenuating cocaine-induced locomotor activity will be presented. While not a mixed $\mu$/$\kappa$ opioid, results obtained with GSK1521498, a $\mu$ receptor inverse agonist, will be discussed. Preclinical strategies and successes will lay the groundwork for the further development of mixed $\mu$/$\kappa$ opioid receptor agonists to treat cocaine dependence. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Using molecular imaging techniques, we directly examined the activity of the endogenous opioid system on {micro}-opioid receptors in humans in sustained pain with and without the administration of a placebo. Significant placebo-induced activation of {micro}-opioid receptor-mediated neurotransmission was observed in both higher-order and sub-cortical brain regions, which included the pregenual and subgenual rostral anterior cingulate, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the insular cortex, and the nucleus accumbens. Regional activations were paralleled by lower ratings of pain intensity, reductions in its sensory and affective qualities, and in the negative emotional state of the volunteers. These data demonstrate that cognitive factors (e.g., expectation of pain relief) are capable of modulating physical and emotional states through the site-specific activation of {micro}-opioid receptor signaling in the human brain.},

Reward loss is a major source of emotional arousal and conflict that can be modeled in the laboratory in a preparation known as consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC). In cSNC, a group of rats is exposed to a downshift in the incentive value of a sucrose solution that leads to a sharp suppression of consummatory behavior. Research reviewed in this article demonstrates that the opioid system is normally engaged in cSNC and that individual differences in sensitivity to opioid antagonists correlate with fast recovery (resilience) and slow recovery (vulnerability) from reward loss. The co-option of the opioid system into playing a role in adjustment to situations involving psychological pain may be an evolutionary adaptation unique to mammals.},

abstract = {Emotion dysregulation and impulsivity are important factors influencing the development and course of alcohol dependence. However, few empirical studies investigate the association between different aspects of impulsivity (cognitive, attentional, behavioral), emotion regulation, and alcohol use disorder symptoms in the same model. The goal of this study was to assess the association between emotion regulation and different facets of impulsivity among patients with an alcohol use disorder and healthy controls. The sample was comprised of 273 individuals: 180 participants with an alcohol use disorder undergoing inpatient alcohol treatment and 93 healthy controls. Emotion regulation was assessed using the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test subscale. Impulsivity was assessed with Barratt's Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Statistical models tested both the BIS-11 total score, as well as three secondary factors (non-planning, attentional, and motor impulsivity). Findings indicate that individuals with alcohol use disorder symptoms were characterized by poor emotion regulation and high levels of impulsivity in all analyzed domains. Moreover, path analytic models indicated that after accounting for demographic factors (i.e., biological sex, age, education) there was evidence for a significant indirect effect of alcohol use disorder symptomatology on non-planning and attentional impulsivity via emotion regulation. There was no association between emotion regulation and motor impulsivity. These findings indicate the importance of targeting emotion regulation skills as well as behavioral control when treating patients with alcohol use disorder.},

The results indicated that the total number of selections from deck A' and deck B' decreased across trials. However, there was no decrease in selections from deck B'. Detailed analysis of the card selections revealed that some people persisted in selecting from the "risky" deck B' as the number of big losses increased. This tendency was prominent in self-rated deliberative people. However, they were implicitly impulsive, as revealed by the matching familiar figure test.

Here, we report that ethanol facilitates observational fear response. Observer mice exhibited stronger defensive immobility while observing cagemates that received repetitive foot shocks if the observer mice had experienced a brief priming foot shock. This enhancement was associated with an observation-induced recruitment of subsets of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons in the observer mouse that were responsive to its own pain. The vicariously activated ACC neurons projected their axons preferentially to the basolateral amygdala. Ethanol shifted the ACC neuronal balance toward inhibition, facilitated the preferential ACC neuronal recruitment during observation, and enhanced observational fear response, independent of an oxytocin signaling pathway. Furthermore, ethanol enhanced socially evoked fear response in autism model mice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to ethanol (EtOH) reduces the expression of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, known to control various physiological functions including the organismal stress response. In this study, we determined whether the changes in POMC neuronal functions are associated with altered expressions of histone-modifying and DNA-methylating enzymes in POMC-producing neurons, because these enzymes are known to be involved in regulation of gene expression. In addition, we tested whether gestational choline supplementation prevents the adverse effects of EtOH on these neurons.\n\nMETHODS: Pregnant rat dams were fed with alcohol-containing liquid diet or control diet during gestational days 7 and 21 with or without choline, and their male offspring rats were used during the adult period. Using double-immunohistochemistry, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and methylation-specific RT-PCR, we determined protein and mRNA levels of histone-modifying and DNA-methylating enzymes and the changes in POMC gene methylation and expression in the hypothalamus of adult male offspring rats. Additionally, we measured the basal- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced corticosterone levels in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nRESULTS: Prenatal EtOH treatment suppressed hypothalamic levels of protein and mRNA of histone activation marks (H3K4me3, Set7/9, acetylated H3K9, phosphorylated H3S10), and increased the repressive marks (H3K9me2, G9a, Setdb1), DNA-methylating enzyme (Dnmt1), and the methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2). The treatment also elevated the level of POMC gene methylation, while it reduced levels of POMC mRNA and $\beta$-EP and elevated corticosterone response to LPS. Gestational choline normalized the EtOH-altered protein and the mRNA levels of H3K4me3, Set7/9, H3K9me2, G9a, Setdb1, Dnmt1, and MeCP2. It also normalizes the changes in POMC gene methylation and gene expression, $\beta$-EP production, and the corticosterone response to LPS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that prenatal EtOH modulates histone and DNA methylation in POMC neurons that may be resulting in hypermethylation of POMC gene and reduction in POMC gene expression. Gestational choline supplementation prevents the adverse effects of EtOH on these neurons.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that drugs of abuse activate the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, and it is widely held that this activation contributes to the motivational and positive reinforcing properties of these substances. However, there is evidence that endogenous opioid systems within this brain reward circuit also play a role in drug reinforcement and drug-seeking behavior. Using microdialysis in freely moving rats, we sought to determine whether various drugs of abuse (i.e., ethanol, cocaine, d-amphetamine, and nicotine) would increase neurotransmission of endogenous opioid peptides (i.e., endorphins) in the nucleus accumbens. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally twice at 3 h intervals, and the endorphin content of microdialysates was analyzed by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Acute administration of ethanol, cocaine, and d-amphetamine transiently elevated extracellular levels of endorphins in the nucleus accumbens, whereas nicotine and saline were without effect. We hypothesize that this drug-induced release of endorphins may contribute to the positive reinforcing and motivating properties of ethanol and psychostimulants.},

abstract = {Pharmacological studies in prairie voles have suggested that the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin play important roles in behaviors associated with monogamy, including affiliation, paternal care, and pair bonding. Our laboratory has investigated the cellular and neuroendocrine mechanisms by which these peptides influence affiliative behavior and social attachment in prairie voles. Monogamous prairie voles have a higher density of oxytocin receptors in the nucleus accumbens than do nonmonogamous vole species; blockade of these receptors by site-specific injection of antagonist in the female prairie vole prevents partner preference formation. Prairie voles also have a higher density of vasopressin receptors in the ventral pallidal area, which is the major output of the nucleus accumbens, than montane voles. Both the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum are key relay nuclei in the brain circuits implicated in reward, such as the mesolimbic dopamine and opioid systems. Therefore, we hypothesize that oxytocin and vasopressin may be facilitating affiliation and social attachment in monogamous species by modulating these reward pathways. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in the integration of reward with motor function, and it receives dense dopamine innervation and extensive limbic and cortical afferents. Here, we examined the specific role of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in mediating associative learning, locomotor activity, and regulating NAc neural responses by using D2R-knockout (KO) mice and their wild-type littermates. D2R-KO mice displayed reduced locomotor activity and slower acquisition of a place-learning task. D2R-KO eliminated the prereward inhibitory response of neurons in the NAc. In contrast, an increased number of neurons in D2R-KO mice displayed place-related activity. These results provide evidence that D2R in the NAc participates in coding for a specific type of neural response to incentive contingencies and partly in spatial learning.},

abstract = {Beyond breathing, the regulation of body temperature-thermoregulation-is one of the most pressing concerns for many animals. A dysregulated body temperature has dire consequences for survival and development. Despite the high frequency of social thermoregulation occurring across many species, little is known about the role of social thermoregulation in human (social) psychological functioning. We outline a theory of social thermoregulation and reconsider earlier research on people's expectations of their social world (i.e., attachment) and their prediction of the social world. We provide support and outline a research agenda that includes consequences for individual variation in self-regulatory strategies and capabilities. In our paper, we discuss physiological, neural, and social processes surrounding thermoregulation. Emphasizing social thermoregulation in particular, we appeal to the economy of action principle and the hierarchical organization of human thermoregulatory systems. We close with future directions of a crucial aspect of human functioning: the social regulation of body temperature.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article reports qualitative findings from a sample of 31 purposively chosen injection drug users (IDUs) from Vancouver, Surreyand Victoria, British Columbia interviewed to examine the context of safe injection site in transforming their lives. Further, the purpose is to determine whether the first and only Supervised injection facility (SIF) in North America, InSite, needs to be expanded to other cities.  METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in a classical anthropological strategy of conversational format as drug users were actively involved in their routine activities. Purposive sampling combined with snowball sampling techniques was employed to recruit the participants. Audio recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically using NVivo 9 software.  RESULTS: Attending InSite has numerous positive effects on the lives of IDUs including: saving lives, reducing HIV and HCV risk behavior, decreasing injection in public, reducing public syringe disposal, reducing use of various medical resources and increasing access to nursing and other  primary health services. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to expand the current facility to cities where injection drug use is prevalent to reduce overdose deaths, reduce needle sharing, reduce hospital emergency care, and increase safety. In addition, InSite's positive changes have contributed to a cultural transformation in drug use within the Downtown Eastside and neighboring communities.},

abstract = {In order to determine the relationship between endorphins and social attachment, the effects of morphine (an opiate agonist) and naloxone (an opiate antagonist) on various indices of attachment in guinea pigs were studied. In infants, crying or separation-induced distress vocalizations were significantly decreased by single injections of low morphine doses (0.25, .050 and 0.75 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. Naloxone (1 mg/kg) reliably increased separation distress vocalizations in both juvenile and adult guinea pigs. Therefore, similar to opiate withdrawal symptoms, separation distress appeared to be alleviated by morphine and potentiated by naloxone. As for approach attachment, offspring/maternal proximity-maintenance time was significantly decreased by morphine (1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg), suggesting that opiates may be capable of replacing a function normally subserved by endorphins in reinforcing attachments. These data support the hypothesis that an endorphin-based addiction-like process may underlie the maintenance of social attachments, and that separation distress may reflect a state of endogenous "endorphin withdrawal". {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The opioid antagonist nalmefene (selincro{\textregistered}) was approved for alcohol-related disorders by the European Medicines Agency in 2013. However, there have been no studies regarding the effectiveness of nalmefene in the combined use of alcohol and cocaine. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using operant alcohol self-administration in Wistar rats and qRT-PCR, we evaluated (a) the dose-response curve for subcutaneous and oral nalmefene; (b) the effects of nalmefene with increasing concentrations of alcohol; (c) the efficacy of nalmefene on cocaine-induced increases in alcohol responses; and (d) the gene expression profiles of histone deacetylases (Hdac1-11) in peripheral blood in vivo and in the prefrontal cortex, heart, liver and kidney post mortem. KEY RESULTS Subcutaneous (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 mg/kg) and oral (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) nalmefene reduced dose-dependently the operant responses for alcohol up to 50.3%. Nalmefene systematically reduced alcohol self-administration independently from alcohol concentration (10%, 15%, 20%). While cocaine caused an increase of approximately 40% in alcohol responses, this result was fully reversed with a low dose of nalmefene (0.05 mg/kg). Additionally, alcohol caused a general increase in Hdac gene expression in blood, which was reduced in Hdac3, 8, 5, 7, 9, 6, 10 by nalmefene. In the other tissues, alcohol and nalmefene either did not alter the gene expression of Hdacs, as in the prefrontal cortex, or the gene expression showed a tissue-Hdac-specific effect. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Nalmefene might be effective in the treatment of the combined use of alcohol and cocaine, and Hdacs gene expression in peripheral blood might be used as a biomarker of alcohol use and drug response.},

abstract = {This new edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5?), used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders, is the product of more than 10 years of effort by hundreds of international experts in all aspects of mental health. Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings -- inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM-5? easier to use across all settings: ? The chapter organization reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders typically diagnosed in childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual, and those more typical of older adults (such as neurocognitive disorders) placed at the end. Also included are age-related factors specific to diagnosis. ? The latest findings in neuroimaging and genetics have been integrated into each disorder along with gender and cultural considerations.? The revised organizational structure recognizes symptoms that span multiple diagnostic categories, providing new clinical insight in diagnosis. ? Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder; the streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders; the restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity; and the enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders).? Dimensional assessments for research and validation of clinical results have been provided.? Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes are included for each disorder, and the organizational structure is consistent with the new ICD-11 in development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers of all orientations. The information contained in the manual is also valuable to other physicians and health professionals, including psychologists, counselors, nurses, and occupational and rehabilitation therapists, as well as social workers and forensic and legal specialists.},

Mu-receptors are involved in motor and sensory functions, and their modulation is established for treatment of diarrhea. Mu-antagonists have potential to reverse endogenous (e.g., postoperative ileus) or iatrogenic dysmotility (e.g., opioid bowel dysfunction). Modulation of the function of kappa-receptors may be a novel approach to control visceral pain in functional gut disorders. Results of formal testing of novel opioid modulators are keenly awaited.},

abstract = {Despite tremendous efforts in the search for safe, efficacious and non-addictive opioids for pain treatment, morphine remains the most valuable painkiller in contemporary medicine. Opioids exert their pharmacological actions through three opioid-receptor classes, mu, delta and kappa, whose genes have been cloned. Genetic approaches are now available to delineate the contribution of each receptor in opioid function in vivo. Here we disrupt the mu-opioid-receptor gene in mice by homologous recombination and find that there are no overt behavioural abnormalities or major compensatory changes within the opioid system in these animals. Investigation of the behavioural effects of morphine reveals that a lack of mu receptors abolishes the analgesic effect of morphine, as well as place-preference activity and physical dependence. We observed no behavioural responses related to delta- or kappa-receptor activation with morphine, although these receptors are present and bind opioid ligands. We conclude that the mu-opioid-receptor gene product is the molecular target of morphine in vivo and that it is a mandatory component of the opioid system for morphine action.},

abstract = {The goal of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between cannabinoid and opioid systems in drug dependence. The CB(1) cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716A precipitated both paw tremors and head shakes in four different mouse strains that were treated repeatedly with Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC). SR 141716A-precipitated Delta(9)-THC withdrawal was ameliorated in mu-opioid receptor knockout mice compared with the wild-type control animals and failed to occur in mice devoid of CB(1) cannabinoid receptors. An acute injection of morphine in Delta(9)-THC-dependent mice undergoing SR 1417161A-precipitated withdrawal dose dependently decreased both paw tremors, antagonist dose 50 (AD(50)) (95% CL) = 0.035 (0.03--0.04), and head shakes, AD(50) (95% CL) = 0.07 (0.04--0.12). In morphine-dependent mice, the opioid antagonist naloxone precipitated head shakes, paw tremors, diarrhea, and jumping. As previously reported, naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal failed to occur in mu-opioid knockout mice and was significantly decreased in CB(1) cannabinoid receptor knockout mice. Acute treatment of Delta(9)-THC in morphine-dependent mice undergoing naloxone-precipitated withdrawal blocked paw tremors, AD(50) (95% CL) = 0.5 (0.3--1.0), and head shakes AD(50) (95% CL) = 0.6 (0.57--0.74) in dose-dependent manners, but failed to diminish the occurrence of diarrhea or jumping. Finally, naloxone and SR 141716A failed to elicit any overt effects in Delta(9)-THC-dependent and morphine-dependent mice, respectively. These findings taken together indicate that the mu-opioid receptor plays a modulatory role in cannabinoid dependence, thus implicating a reciprocal relationship between the cannabinoid and opioid systems in dependence.},

abstract = {The treatment of cocaine dependence is difficult as no approved pharmacotherapy is available as yet. However, in preclinical and clinical trials, a variety of compounds were tested for suitability as inhibitors of craving for and relapse into the use of cocaine, among these antidepressants, antiepileptics, dopamine agonists, disulfiram, and naltrexone. Nalmefene, a structural derivative of naltrexone, shares with its parent compound approval (granted by the European Medical Agency in 2013) as a medication for the treatment of alcohol addiction in the European Union. It differs from naltrexone by a higher affinity for the opioid-receptors and a partial agonistic affinity to the opioid-receptors. It should be noted that patients addicted to cocaine show a considerable increase in receptors in the nucleus accumbens. This report describes the case of an abstinent cocaine-addicted patient regularly afflicted with cravings for cocaine. The patient took as-needed nalmefene for 5 months whenever she developed a craving for cocaine. For most of these interventions, the patient reported an abatement of craving and could avoid relapsing into cocaine consumption. This effect may be accounted for by nalmefene acting, other than naltrexone, as a partial agonist of the opioid-receptors. Therefore, nalmefene might be a promising new option in the pharmacological repertoire for the treatment of cocaine addiction.},

abstract = {The opioid antagonist nalmefene offers an alternative to traditional pharmacological treatments for alcoholism. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between nalmefene plasma concentration and central mu-opioid receptor occupancy after a clinically effective dose (20 mg, orally). Pharmacokinetics and mu-opioid receptor occupancy of nalmefene after single and repeated dosing over 7 days was studied in 12 healthy subjects. Serial blood samples were obtained after both dosings, and pharmacokinetic parameters for nalmefene and main metabolites were determined. Central mu-opioid receptor occupancy of nalmefene was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C]carfentanil at four time points (3, 26, 50, 74 h) after both dosings. Nalmefene was rapidly absorbed in all subjects. The mean t(1/2) of nalmefene was 13.4 h after single and repeated dosing. The accumulation of nalmefene and its main metabolites in plasma during the repeated dosing period was as expected for a drug with linear pharmacokinetics, and steady-state was reached for all analytes. Both nalmefene dosings resulted in a very high occupancy at mu-opioid receptors (87-100%), and the decline in the occupancy was similar after both dosings but clearly slower than the decline in the plasma concentration of nalmefene or metabolites. High nalmefene occupancy (83-100%) persisted at 26 h after the dosings. The prolonged mu-opioid receptor occupancy by nalmefene indicates slow dissociation of the drug from mu-opioid receptors. These results support the rational of administering nalmefene when needed before alcohol drinking, and they additionally suggest that a high mu-opioid receptor occupancy can be maintained when nalmefene is taken once daily.},

abstract = {Translating advances in neuroscience into benefits for patients with mental illness presents enormous challenges because it involves both the most complex organ, the brain, and its interaction with a similarly complex environment. Dealing with such complexities demands powerful techniques. Computational psychiatry combines multiple levels and types of computation with multiple types of data in an effort to improve understanding, prediction and treatment of mental illness. Computational psychiatry, broadly defined, encompasses two complementary approaches: data driven and theory driven. Data-driven approaches apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional data to improve classification of disease, predict treatment outcomes or improve treatment selection. These approaches are generally agnostic as to the underlying mechanisms. Theory-driven approaches, in contrast, use models that instantiate prior knowledge of, or explicit hypotheses about, such mechanisms, possibly at multiple levels of analysis and abstraction. We review recent advances in both approaches, with an emphasis on clinical applications, and highlight the utility of combining them.},

Addition of quinine in both drinking bottles increased preference for alcohol, while dilution of saccharin in both bottles totally suppressed this preference for the alcohol bottle. In this alcohol-water choice procedure, naloxone decreased the amount of alcohol intake without altering the amount drunk from the water bottle. This decrease was independent of the palatable or nonpalatable substances added to alcohol and of the percentage of alcohol. Possible explanations for the findings include the possibilities that naloxone selectively decreases the rewarding property of alcohol or that naloxone interferes with the caloric requirements of the animal and thus accelerates the satiety mechanism for alcohol.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The authors' goal was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of naltrexone in the treatment of pathologic gambling disorder. METHODS: Eighty-three subjects who met criteria for DSM-IV pathologic gambling disorder were enrolled in a 1-week single-blind placebo lead-in followed by an 11-week double-blind naltrexone or placebo trial. Naltrexone was started at 25 mg/day and titrated upward until maximum symptom improvement or 250 mg/day was achieved. Gambling symptom change was assessed with the patient-rated Clinical Global Impression (PG-CGI-PT), clinician-rated CGI (PG-CGI-MD), and the Gambling Symptom Rating Scale (G-SAS). Side effects were monitored weekly and liver function tests biweekly. RESULTS: Data from 45 patients were analyzed. Using random regression analysis, significant improvement was noted in all three gambling symptom measures: patient-rated Clinical Global Impression, p <.001; clinician-rated CGI, p <.001; Gambling Symptom Rating Scale, p <.019. At study end, 75% of subjects taking naltrexone were much or very much improved on both the PE-CEI PT and the PG-CGI-MD, compared with only 24% of those on placebo. Elevated liver enzymes occurred in four subjects who were taking analgesics concurrently. Nausea was common during the first week of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that naltrexone is effective in reducing the symptoms of pathologic gambling. Until further studies corroborate the present findings, our report should be interpreted cautiously.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pathological gambling is a disabling disorder experienced by approximately 1%-2% of adults and for which there are few empirically validated treatments. The authors examined the efficacy and tolerability of the opioid antagonist nalmefene in the treatment of adults with pathological gambling. METHOD: A 16-week, randomized, dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 15 outpatient treatment centers across the United States between March 2002 and April 2003. Two hundred seven persons with DSM-IV pathological gambling were randomly assigned to receive nalmefene (25 mg/day, 50 mg/day, or 100 mg/day) or placebo. Scores on the primary outcome measure (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling) were analyzed by using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Estimated regression coefficients showed that the 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day nalmefene groups had significantly different scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling, compared to the placebo group. A total of 59.2% of the subjects who received 25 mg/day of nalmefene were rated as "much improved" or "very much improved" at the last evaluation, compared to 34.0% of those who received placebo. Adverse experiences included nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who received nalmefene had a statistically significant reduction in severity of pathological gambling. Low-dose nalmefene (25 mg/day) appeared efficacious and was associated with few adverse events. Higher doses (50 mg/day and 100 mg/day) resulted in intolerable side effects.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Although opiate antagonists have shown promise in the treatment of pathological gambling (PG), individual responses vary. No studies have systematically examined predictors of medication treatment outcome in PG. Understanding clinical variables related to treatment outcome should help generate treatment algorithms for PG.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We sought to identify clinical variables associated with treatment outcome in PG subjects receiving opiate antagonists.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-four subjects [137 (48.2%) women] with DSM-IV PG were treated in one of two double-blind placebo-controlled trials (16 weeks of nalmefene or 18 weeks of naltrexone). Gambling severity was assessed with the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling (PG-YBOCS) with positive response defined as > or =35% reduction in PG-YBOCS score for at least 1 month by study endpoint. Depression, anxiety, and psychosocial functioning were included in stepwise logistic regression analyses designed to identify clinical factors independently associated with treatment response.\n\nRESULTS: The clinical variable most strongly associated with a positive response to an opiate antagonist was a positive family history of alcoholism (p = 0.006). Among individuals receiving higher doses of opiate antagonists (i.e., nalmefene 50 or 100 mg/day or naltrexone 100 or 150 mg/day), intensity of gambling urges (PG-YBOCS urge subscale) was associated with a positive response on a trend level (p = 0.036). Among individuals receiving placebo, younger age was associated, on a trend level, with positive treatment outcome (p = 0.012).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A family history of alcoholism appears to predict response to an opiate antagonist in PG. Future research is needed to identify specific factors (e.g., genetic) mediating favorable responses.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that eating disorders are a compulsive behaviour disease, characterized by frequent recall of anorexic thoughts. Evidence suggests that memory is a neocortical neuronal network, excitation of which involves the hippocampus, with recall occurring by re-excitement of the same specific network. Excitement of the hippocampus by glutamate-NMDA receptors, leading to long-term potentiation (LTP), can be blocked by ketamine. Continuous block of LTP prevents new memory formation but does not affect previous memories. Opioid antagonists prevent loss of consciousness with ketamine but do not prevent the block of LTP. We used infusions of 20 mg per hour ketamine for 10 h with 20 mg twice daily nalmefene as opioid antagonist to treat 15 patients with a long history of eating disorder, all of whom were chronic and resistant to several other forms of treatment. Nine (responders) showed prolonged remission when treated with two to nine ketamine infusions at intervals of 5 days to 3 weeks. Clinical response was associated with a significant decrease in Compulsion score: before ketamine, mean +/- SE was 44.0 +/- 2.5; after ketamine, 27.0 +/- 3.5 (t test, p = 0.0016). In six patients (non-responders) the score was: before ketamine, 42.8 +/- 3.7; after ketamine, 44.8 +/- 3.1. There was no significant response to at least five ketamine treatments, perhaps because the compulsive drive was re-established too soon after the infusion, or because the dose of opioid antagonist, nalmefene, was too low.},

She had been suffering from binge eating disorder (BED) since her adolescence but had hidden the disorder until the marriage, when she revealed the problem to her husband. This case report highlights the potential use of nalmefene in the treatment of BED. Nalmefene is a new compound combining micro and delta receptor (MOR and DOR) antagonism and kappa receptor (KOR) partial agonism. In conclusion, our case report underlines that nalmefene might represent a new pharmacological paradigm in terms of therapeutic target in BED and other food craving conditions. Further, it suggests that nalmefene may be prescribed also daily and not only when needed, to improve food addiction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nalmefene is a newer opioid antagonist that is structurally similar to naltrexone but with a number of potential pharmacological advantages for the treatment of alcohol dependence, including no dose-dependent association with toxic effects to the liver, greater oral bioavailability, longer duration of antagonist action, and more competitive binding with opioid receptor subtypes that are thought to reinforce drinking. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of oral nalmefene for alcohol dependence. The 105 outpatient volunteers were abstinent for a mean of 2 weeks prior to random assignment to the placebo or 20- or 80-mg/d dose nalmefene groups for 12 weeks. Cognitive behavioral therapy was provided weekly during treatment. Self-reported drinking or abstinence was confirmed by determinations of breath alcohol concentration and by collateral informant reports. RESULTS: Outcomes did not differ between the 20- and 80-mg dose nalmefene groups. Significantly fewer patients treated with nalmefene than patients given placebo relapsed to heavy drinking through 12 weeks of treatment (P<.02), with a significant treatment effect at the first weekly study visit (P<.02). The odds ratio of relapsing to heavy drinking was 2.4 times greater with placebo compared with nalmefene (95% confidence interval, 1.05-5.59). Patients treated with nalmefene also had fewer subsequent relapses (P<.03) than patients given placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with nalmefene was effective in preventing relapse to heavy drinking relative to placebo in alcohol-dependent outpatients and was accompanied by acceptable side effects.},

abstract = {Controlled drinking has long been a controversial topic in behavior therapy. The historical context of this debate is reviewed, with special attention paid to the pioneering research conducted by Mark and Linda Sobell (the first behavior therapists to publish a controlled trial of controlled drinking with alcoholics). After updating the research findings and predictors of controlled drinking with alcohol-dependent drinkers, literature on the effects of moderation training (including brief interventions) designed to reduce the risks of alcohol abuse is reviewed. As an illustration of this approach, preliminary data are presented from an ongoing study investigating the effects of a stepped-care secondary prevention program for high-risk adolescent and young-adult drinkers. Throughout the paper, harm reduction is presented as an overarching model of behavior change that encompasses both controlled drinking for alcohol dependence and moderation training in the prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse. Unlike abstinence-only or "zero-tolerance" approaches, the harm-reduction model supports any behavior change, from moderation to abstinence, that reduces the harm of problems due to alcohol. {\textcopyright} 1993 Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy.

Two groups of AA participants were distinguished based on degree of AA involvement. RR participants constituted the third group. As predicted, the Surrender instrument was able to discrimi-nate between the High AA, Low AA, and RR groups, with the High AA group scoring above the other groups on surrender. Results suggest there is more to the act of surrender than level of involve-ment, length of sobriety, or degree of dependence on alcohol. Some support is provided for AA's philosophy that surrendering to a Higher Power occurs during the course of alcohol recovery. Results suggested there is a negative correlation between pathological nar-cissism and surrender. Unfortunately, firm conclusions could not be drawn from this study regarding narcissism.

Deficits in the ability to recognize the emotions of others are believed to contribute to this. There is currently no effective treatment for these problems. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design, we administered oxytocin nasal spray (18 or 24 IU) or a placebo to 16 male youth aged 12 to 19 who were diagnosed with Autistic or Asperger's Disorder. Participants then completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, a widely used and reliable test of emotion recognition. Results: In comparison with placebo, oxytocin administration improved performance on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task. This effect was also shown when analysis was restricted to the younger participants aged 12 to 15 who received the lower dose. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that oxytocin nasal spray improves emotion recognition in young people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. Findings suggest the potential of earlier intervention and further evaluation of oxytocin nasal spray as a treatment to improve social communication and interaction in young people with autism spectrum disorders. ?? 2010 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},
