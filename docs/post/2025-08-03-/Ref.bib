abstract = {Abstract The three principles of reinforcement are (1) events such as incentives and reinforcers increase the activity of an organism; (2) that activity is bounded by competition from other responses; and (3) animals approach incentives and their signs, guided by their temporal and physical conditions, together called the ?contingencies of reinforcement.? Mathematical models of each of these principles comprised mathematical principles of reinforcement (MPR; Killeen, 1994). Over the ensuing decades, MPR was extended to new experimental contexts. This article reviews the basic theory and its extensions to satiation, warm-up, extinction, sign tracking, pausing, and sequential control in progressive-ratio and multiple schedules. In the latter cases, a single equation balancing target and competing responses governs behavioral contrast and behavioral momentum. Momentum is intrinsic in the fundamental equations, as behavior unspools more slowly from highly aroused responses conditioned by higher rates of incitement than it does from responses from leaner contexts. Habits are responses that have accrued substantial behavioral momentum. Operant responses, being predictors of reinforcement, are approached by making them: The sight and feel of a paw on a lever is approached by placing paw on lever, as attempted for any sign of reinforcement. Behavior in concurrent schedules is governed by approach to momentarily richer patches (melioration). Applications of MPR in behavioral pharmacology and delay discounting are noted.},

abstract = {Mathematical Principles of Reinforcement (MPR) is a theory of reinforcement schedules. This paper reviews the origin of the principles constituting MPR: arousal, association and constraint. Incentives invigorate responses, in particular those preceding and predicting the incentive. The process that generates an associative bond between stimuli, responses and incentives is called coupling. The combination of arousal and coupling constitutes reinforcement. Models of coupling play a central role in the evolution of the theory. The time required to respond constrains the maximum response rates, and generates a hyperbolic relation between rate of responding and rate of reinforcement. Models of control by ratio schedules are developed to illustrate the interaction of the principles. Correlations among parameters are incorporated into the structure of the models, and assumptions that were made in the original theory are refined in light of current data.},
